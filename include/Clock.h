/** Deterministic aging with random early death.
This clock has the agent age each period but allows for a state-dependent probability that they
die before the start of the next period.

Death is a transition to the maximum value of the counter, <code>t.N-1</code = T*.  This allows
for endogenous bequest motives which are computed before iterating backwards on other ages.

The probability of death should be a `CV`-compatible quantity.
