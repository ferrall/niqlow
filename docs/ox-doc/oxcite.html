<dl>
<dt>Ox should be cited whenever it is used. For example you could say in
the text:

<dd>the results are generated using Ox version 7.00 (see Doornik, 2012)
and the Arfima package version 1.00 (Doornik and Ooms, 2003)
<dt>and then give the references:
<dd>

<p>
Ox is available from <a href="http://www.timberlake.co.uk/" target="_top">Timberlake Consultants</a>.

<p>
Ox and all its components are copyright of Jurgen A. Doornik.
The Console (command line) versions may be used freely
for academic research and teaching purposes only; the Professional version
(i.e. using OxRun/OxDebug/OxMetrics/oxli) is not free. Commercial users,
academics and students who do externally funded research,
and others who do not qualify for the free version must purchase the
Professional version of Ox and OxMetrics with documentation, regardless of
which version they use (so even when only using Ox on Linux or Unix).
Failure to cite the use of Ox in published work may result in
loss of the right to use the free version, and an invoice at the
full commercial price.
<p>
If you redistribute modified versions of code written by me, you
must change the filenames, clearly indicate the original source,
and take over the responsibility of supporting that code. Only code
which explicitly allows this can be redistributed in this way.
Remember that often new functionality can be implemented by deriving
from an existing class (instead of adjusting the base class).
Redistribution of Ox in any form is not permitted. It is also not permitted
to translate any Ox code that is supplied with the Ox system into
another language or other code system.
<p>
The Ox syntax is public, and, of course, you may do with your
own Ox code whatever you wish. If you make your code available to
others, I would appreciate it if you could provide proper documentation
(such as, for example, in the Arfima package). Also, try to avoid
global variables: either wrap the code in a class, or hide the globals
with the static keyword, providing functions to set the values.
<p>
You may not charge for any of the components which are made available
by me. Contact me if you wish to distribute Ox with other products.
Note that Ox is not open source; however, you can extend ox by writing
dynamic link libraries that can be called from Ox.

<dt>NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER IS GIVEN FOR THESE PROGRAMS.
