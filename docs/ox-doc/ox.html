<h2><a id="ox_over_desc"></a>Brief description</h2><p>

<b>Ox</b> is an object-oriented matrix programming language with a
comprehensive mathematical and statistical function library.
Matrices can be used directly in expressions, for example to multiply
two matrices, or to invert a matrix. The major features
of Ox are its speed, extensive library, and well-designed syntax,
which leads to programs which are easier to maintain.

For a first impression of the matrix and statistical function library
see the	<a href="oxsumry.html">Function summary</a>.
Versions of Ox are available for many <a href="#ox_over_which">platforms</a>.

<p>
<h3><a id="ox_over_ver"></a>Ox version</h3><p>

This documentation refers to version 7.00.

<h2><a id="ox_over_data"></a>Ox supported data file formats</h2><p>

Ox can read (and write) the following data files directly into a matrix:

<ul>
<li>.mat (ASCII matrix file),</li>

<li>.dat (ASCII data file with load information),</li>

<li>.in7 (PcGive 7 data file, with data in .bn7 file),</li>

<li>.xls (Excel old-format worksheet file),</li>

<li>.xlsx (Excel 2007 and newer worksheet or workbook file),</li>

<li>.csv (comma separated data file),</li>

<li>.dht (Gauss data file, with data in .dat file),</li>

<li>.fmt (Gauss matrix file).</li>

<li>.dta (Stata data file, version 4--6 and 11).</li>
</ul>

<p>Data files are loaded into a matrix using the
<a href="oxstd.html#loadmat"><tt>loadmat()</tt></a> function.
Alternatively, the <a href="oxclass.html#Database">Database class</a>
can be used to load data files with sample period and variable
names. The database function is <b>Load</b>.

<p>In addition, there are text and binary functions for reading and
writing.
</p>

<p>
<h2><a id="ox_over_pack"></a>Ox packages</h2><p>

Packages extend the functionality of Ox in various ways.
Once installed, they become an integrated part of Ox.
Some packages just add a few useful functions, whereas
others offer their functionality in an extensive class.
A package is also a convenient way for communicating research.

<p>
Check <i><a href="http://www.doornik.com/download.html#oxpack">
www.doornik.com/download.html</a></i> for additional code and packages.
A few are listed here:

are maximum likelihood and nonlinear least squares. The Arfima class derives
from the database class to give easy loading of data sets and sample selection.
An additional simulation class allows Monte Carlo experimentation of the
facilities in the estimation class.
The Arfima package can also be used as an OxPack package.

<dt><b>Bootstrap and Simulation Classes</b>

automatically from within Ox.
The resulting GnuPlot-files are in plain ASCII, and can be adapted to 
fit final needs.
Output of the GnuPlot files can be of many different types. Included is
support for EPS (bw and color), GIF and TeX.

<dt><b>Lapack</b>
<dd>
Lapack is a package for solving linear equations, linear least
squares problems, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems.  
This is a port to Ox of the main driver files for real and
symmetric matrices from <tt>lapack</tt>, which is in netlib.

ARIMA/GARCH data series.

<dt><b>PcNaive</b>
<dd>
PcNaive is an Ox Professional package for designing
Monte Carlo experiments of dynamic econometric
models by David Hendry and Jurgen Doornik.
There is a set of interactive dialogs in which the
data generation process (DGP) and model are formulated,
and the statistics of interest are selected. PcNaive then
generates and runs an Ox program. The output appears in
OxMetrics and can include:
<ul>
<li> theoretical analysis of the DGP,
<li> live graphical output as the experiment progresses,
<li> numerical output of final results.
</ul>
PcNaive comes with a 200 page book, containing
extensive tutorials introducing Monte Carlo analysis, and
showing how the program can be used. A separate part
discusses how PcNaive can be used in teaching
econometrics, starting from the elementary through
intermediate and finally advanced econometrics. 
PcNaive is available from Timberlake Consultants.

<dt><b>Quantile regression</b>

<p>
Ox can be run in four ways:
<ol>
<li>from the console (command line) using <tt>oxl</tt> (bin64/oxl in 64-bit Windows;
oxl64 in 64-bit Linux).
<p>
Graphs cannot be displayed.

<li>from <tt>OxEdit</tt> (the `running person' icon) using <tt>oxl</tt>
<p>
Graphs cannot be displayed.

<li>from <tt>OxMetrics</tt> (either using OxRun or the `running person' icon)
<p>
Graphs are shown in OxMetrics. This requires Ox Professional.

<li>from the console (command line) using <tt>oxli</tt>
<p>
This supports command line debugging and interactive use.
Graphs cannot be displayed. This requires Ox Professional.

</ol>

Console indicates whether the tool is launched from the command
line, or using an interactive program.
The first yes/no under graphics indicates whether graphs can be
created and saved to disk, the second whether graphs can be displayed
on screen by Ox.

<p>
Send an email to
<a href="mailto:jurgen.doornik@nuffield.ox.ac.uk">jurgen.doornik@nuffield.ox.ac.uk</a>
if you need Ox on other platforms. Most versions allow extending
Ox using DLLs; you can also make direct calls to the underlying C code.

<p>
<h2><a id="ox_over_avail"></a>Availability of Ox</h2><p>

Please check availability on my
<i><a href="http://www.doornik.com">
work page</a></i> to download the most recent version of Ox.

<p>
The Windows version, <b>Ox Professional</b>, is published by 

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.timberlake.co.uk/" target="_top"><i>Timberlake Consultants</i></a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Users at companies and other commercial users (including users
at non-educational institutions, and academics using Ox for
consulting) are welcome to download
versions of Ox for evaluation purposes.
However, when deciding to use Ox seriously, they are expected to purchase
the Windows version of Ox and OxMetrics with documentation,
regardless of which version they actually do use.
More information may be found under <a href="oxcite.html">citation</a>.

<p>
<h2><a id="ox_over_fast"></a>Ox is fast</h2><p>

Ox is faster than most other matrix programming languages.
<i><a href="http://www.doornik.com/products.html#Ox">Some
benchmarks</a></i> are available.

<p>
<h2><a id="oxpath"></a>OX7PATH</h2><p>

Ox 7.x uses the <tt>OX7PATH</tt> environment variable if this has been set.
Under Windows there is no need to set this variables
anymore, because the system will use a default (determined from
the location of oxwin.dll), e.g.

<pre>
    c:\ox\include;c:\ox
</pre><p>

if you installed to <tt>c:\ox</tt>. Under Unix, this variable must
always be set, see <a href="readunix.txt">readunix.txt</a>.

Ox will read the <tt>OX7PATH</tt> environment variable on all platforms.
If you do set it, you must include the
default paths. For example, when Ox is run from the network
(<tt>X:\apps\ox</tt> for example), and you wish to also use packages
installed on the local harddisk, you could set:

<pre>
    set OX7PATH=X:\apps\ox\include;X:\apps\ox;c:\ox
</pre><p>

Ox 6.x used the <tt>OX6PATH</tt> environment variable,
allowing Ox version 7 and 6 installations to exist side by side.


<p>
<h2><a id="ox_over_switch"></a>Ox command line options</h2><p>

To run an Ox program from the command-line using oxl:
<pre>
    oxl prog.ox
</pre><p>
In 64-bit linux the default script is oxl64:
<pre>
    oxl64 prog.ox
</pre><p>
To run an OxGauss program from the command-line using oxl:
<pre>
    oxl -g prog.src
</pre><p>
The general syntax is
<pre>
    oxl [options for oxl] program [options for program]
</pre><p>
Arguments before the Ox filename are passed to the compiler,
those after to the running program. So in
<pre>
    oxl -DMYTEXT1 prog.ox -DMYTEXT2
</pre><p>
the string <tt>"-DMYTEXT2"</tt> is not handled by the compiler, but available
to the <tt>prog.ox</tt> program when using the <a href="oxstd.html#arglist">arglist()</a> function.

<p><h3>General switches</h3><p>

<dl>
<dt><b>-c</b><dd> Create an object (<tt>.oxo</tt>) file, there is no linking or
                  running of the file. An <tt>.oxo</tt> file is a binary file
                  which holds compiled Ox code. It can be linked in
                  using the <tt>-l</tt> switch, or using the link <tt>pragma</tt>.
<dt><b>-cl</b><dd>Create object (.oxo) file after linking in dependencies (Ox Professional only).
<dt><b>-d</b>     <dd>Run program in debug mode (with -c: inserts debug
                  information in compiled file).				  
<dt><b>-Dtoken</b><dd>Define tokens, e.g. -DOPTION1+OPTION2 corresponds
                  to the preprocessor statements
                  <dl>
                  <dd><tt>#define OPTION1</tt>
                  <dd><tt>#define OPTION2</tt>
                  </dl>
<dt><b>-g</b>     <dd>The source code is an OxGauss file
<dt><b>-lfilelist</b><dd> Link object file, e.g. -lfile1+file2+file3, which
                  links in the named files (the <tt>.oxo</tt> extension is
                  assumed). If the file cannot be found as specified,
                  the linker will search along the include path.
<dt><b>-i</b>     <dd>Run Ox in interactive mode (at start up the file called
                  <tt>ox_init.ox</tt> is run automatically).
<dt><b>-ipath</b><dd> Appends path in front of the current include path.
                  Initially, the include path is that specified in
                  the <tt>OX7PATH</tt> environment variable (under Windows
                  when <tt>OX7PATH</tt> is not set, the default is obtained
                  from the location of the binary file); use this
                  switch to prepend directories for searching. Use a
                  semicolon to separate directories, e.g.
				  <tt>-id:\myox;c:\myox</tt>. The include path
                  is used to search for files included in search code
                  and link files.
<dt><b>-v#</b><dd>Set verbosity level (-v1 or -v2).
                  Use -v1 to print information on loaded files and required
                  imports as well as canonical and parallel loops.
                  Use -v2 to also print which include files are opened.
<dt><b>-w0</b><dd>Switches off parse warnings.
                  Currently, the parser warns for
                  <dl>
                  <dt><tt>isolated ; is empty statement</tt>
                    <dd>This refers to expressions such as <tt>if (i == 10);</tt>
                        where the semicolon terminates the expression.
                        The warning is also issued for <tt>;</tt> after
                        <tt>for</tt> and <tt>while</tt> statements.
                  <dt><tt>assignment in test expression</tt>
                    <dd>This refers to expressions such as <tt>if (i = 10)</tt>
                        where an assignment is made inside a test expression.
                        The warning is also issued for assignments in
                        <tt>for</tt>, <tt>while</tt>, and <tt>do while</tt> statements.
                  </dl>
<dt><b>-x</b><dd> Clears the current include path. Use this prior to
                  the <tt>-i</tt> switch if you do not wish to search in the
                  directories specified by the <tt>OX7PATH</tt> environment
                  variables.
</dl>

<p><h3>Optimization switches</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>-od</b><dd>Switch code optimizations off. By default this is
                  on. Usually, there is no reason to switch it off, other than to
                  to check for speed differences.
<dt><b>-on</b><dd>Switch line numbering off. Use this switch to prevent
                  the emission of line numbers into the compiled code.
                  This makes error messages less helpful; moreover, the
                  speed improvement is virtually negligable.
</dl>

<p><h3>Run-time switches</h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>-r-</b><dd>Do not run code. The code will be compiled and linked.
                  Could be useful to only do a syntax check.
<dt><b>-rp#</b><dd>Set number of parallel threads (Ox Professional only).
                  The default is the number of processor cores;
                  use <tt>-rp1</tt> to force one thread only (serial code).
<dt><b>-s</b>     <dd>Sets the set symbol table and
                  stack size. The default is
                  <tt>-s3000,1000</tt>. Setting larger sizes is only required
                  when large programs run out of symbol table or stack space.

<p>
<h2><a id="ox_over_path"></a>Using file names in Ox</h2><p>

If you specify full path names of files in a string constant,
you must either use one	forward slash, or two backslashes:
<pre>
    "./data.mat"
</pre><p>
<pre>
    ".\\data.mat"
</pre><p>
Ox will interpret one backslash in a string as an escape sequence
(as in the newline character); 
a single backslash will only work if it does not happen to
form an escape sequence.
Also note that the Windows and Unix versions of Ox can
handle long file names, and that Unix treats file names
in a case sensitive manner.

<p>
<h2><a id="ox_over_ext"></a>Extending Ox</h2><p>

Ox implements a flexible run-time engine, and can be extended in various ways,
for example:

<ul>
<li>Develop an OxPack compatible interactive package when
deriving from the <a href="#Modelbase">Modelbase class</a> (Windows only).

<li>Make extensions to Ox in e.g. C/C++ or Fortran, and put that in a DLL;
such functions are then callable from Ox code. </li>

<li>Use Ox as a mathematics library (e.g. if you are programming in C/C++
but do not want to program in Ox; or to call functions such as Choleski
decomposition or a random number generator in your Ox extension DLL). </li>

<li>Write an interface wrapper around Ox code (Windows only). The Ox book provides
examples of interface wrappers using Visual C++ and Visual Basic.
</li>

<li>It is possible to make callbacks to Ox from a C/C++ extension to Ox
(e.g. to numerically integrate a function defined in Ox, where the integrator
is in C). </li>
</ul>

<p>The documentation is in the <a href="OxDeveloper.pdf">Ox Developer's manual</a>.
<p>Using OxRun, Ox can use OxMetrics as a front-end, which holds databases,
and receives text and graphical output from Ox. </p>
<p>


<h2><a id="ox_over_debug"></a>Debug mode</h2><p>

Most Ox versions have a debug mode, which is entered by
using the <tt>-d</tt> switch (under Windows use oxli intead of oxl).
The <tt>(debug)</tt> prompt
indicates the debug mode. Just pressing enter will
step through the code.

<p>
<em>Local and global variables in .oxo files can only be
seen in the debugger if these have been compiled with the</em>
<tt>-d</tt> <em>switch</em>.

Note that expressions which are entered from the command line
still need to be terminated with a semicolon as usual
(including, for example, when just a few spaces are entered).

<p>
Type a question mark to see the
available commands:

<pre class="small">
#break file line - set breakpoint at line of file
#clear file line - clear breakpoint at line of file
#clear all       - clear all breakpoints
#go              - run to next breakpoint
#go file line    - run to line of file
#go line         - run to line of current file
?                - debug command summary (also: help)
??               - show all symbols and current break
?symbol          - show a symbols
#quit            - stop debugging
#step in         - step (in to function) (also: just press return)
#step over       - step (over function)
#step out        - step out of current function
#show            - shows current break
#show calls      - show call stack
#show variable   - as ?variable
#show breaks     - show all breakpoints
#show all        - show all variables
#show full       - show all variables with full value
#trace           - lists all lines executed
#trace off       - switches trace off
!command         - operating system command
expression       - enter an Ox expression, e.g. x[0][0]=1; or print(x);
</pre><p>


<h2><a id="ox_over_interactive"></a>Interactive mode</h2><p>

Most Ox versions have a interactive mode, which is entered by
using the <tt>-i</tt> switch (under Windows use oxli intead of oxl).
The <tt>(ox)</tt> prompt
indicates the interactive mode. You can then enter Ox code
from the command line. There are the differences from running
a file with code:

<ul>
<li>At startup the file ox_init.ox is run.
<li>Variables assigned to in code entered from the command line need not
be declared explicitly.
</ul><p>

Note that expressions still need to be terminated with a semicolon
as usual.
(including, for example, when just a few spaces are entered).

<p>
Type a question mark to see the
available commands:

<pre class="small">
?              - command summary (also: help)
??             - show all symbols and current break
?symbol        - show a symbols
#new           - clear all code and symbols
#quit          - quit Ox
#show variable - show a named variable with full value (also: ?variable)
#show all      - show all variables
#show full     - show all variables with full value
!command       - operating system command
expression     - enter an expression

<h2><a id="ox_over_oxedit"></a>OxEdit</h2><p>

<i><a href="http://www.doornik.com/products.html#OxEdit">OxEdit</a></i>
is a powerful text editor, and a very useful program in its
own right. OxEdit has some features which are especially useful
when writing Ox programs:

<ul>
<li>Syntax colouring

Three colours are used to distinguish keywords, constants and comment.
This makes the code more readable, and mistakes easier to spot.

<li>Facility to easily comment in or comment out blocks of text

<li>Run Ox programs from inside OxEdit

The first time you use OxEdit, execute the <i>Add Ox modules</i>
command on the <i>Modules</i> menu. From then on you can run
your Ox programs without leaving OxEdit:

<ul>
<li><i>Ox</i> - runs the currently active document window
using oxl.exe.
The output will appear in the window called Ox Output.

<li><i>OxRun</i> - runs the currently active document window
using OxRun.
The output will appear in OxMetrics.

<li><i>Ox - interactive</i> - starts an interactive session.
The input/output window is called Session.ox.

<li><i>Ox - debug</i> - starts a debug session
for the currently active document window.
The input/output window is called Debug.ox.
</ul>
</ul>
