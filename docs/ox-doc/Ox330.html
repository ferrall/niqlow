<hr><h1>Ox 3.30: new features and fixes</h1>


<hr><h2>New features and enhancements</h2>
<p>

<ul>
<li><tt>intersection</tt> index, <tt>exclusion</tt> index

<li>Improved <tt>MaxSimplex</tt> error messages; check for vDelta=0

<li>Threes example for mingw C/C++ compiler

<li><tt>dayofcalender</tt> and <tt>dayofweek</tt> can now be used in the
	  opposite direction

<li>set default fuzziness to 1e-13, and made <tt>range()</tt>
	  for non-integer arguments independent of fuzziness settings.

<li>extended QuadPack with QAW? functions and QPWARN

<li>added <tt>oxprintlevel</tt> to switch printing off

<li>extended <tt>oxwarning</tt>

<li>third/fourth argument of many random
      number generators can now be an r x c matrix.

<li>Can now do indexed assignment to int/double,
	  e.g. <tt>decl x = 1; x[0] = 2;</tt>

<li>String concatenation and substring now use
	  actual size, rather than up to ending \0.

<li>Now allowing string with embedded \0 as well
	  as octal escape sequences.

<li>feof previously returned non-zero after an attempt
      to read past the end of the file. Now it will return TRUE
	  if the next read will be past the end of the file.
</ul>


<hr><h2>Problems in version 3.20 which have been fixed in version 3.30:</h2>

<ul>
<li><tt>sortc(zeros(0,1))</tt> leads to crash

<li><tt>ranwishart</tt> was incomplete and useless.

<li><tt>vech</tt> of scalar returned zero.

<li><tt>Database::RemoveObsIf()</tt> and <tt>Database::Grow()</tt>
      would result in <tt>GetYear2()</tt> and <tt>GetSample2()</tt> to be out by
	  one observation.

<li>Use of -i.. switch under Linux/Unix could lead to a crash.

<li><tt>MaxSQP</tt>: equality constraints only: merit function
	  could become .NaN if the weights of the inequality constraints
	  (eventhough they should be irrelevant) end up at zero.

<li><tt>Database</tt> class: for monthly data, the first seasonal
	  variable did not correspond to January.

<li>calls of type var-&gt;class::function was not allowed
      inside other classes.
	  
<li>Calls to <tt>SetDraw</tt> before any drawing functions would
      be ignored when running via oxl.

<li><tt>outer(mx,&lt;&gt;,'o')</tt> gave empty matrix error message

<li><tt>deleter(x, 0);</tt> also deletes missing values,
	  but should only delete rows with zeros. Same for deletec.

<li>densities/probabilities of distributions
	  defined over (0,Inf) sometimes returned
	  the wrong value for arguments in (-Inf,0].

<li><tt>invert,invertsym,invertgen</tt> return empty matrix
      if argument is empty matrix.



<li>
OxGauss (thanks to S&eacute;bastien Laurent)
<ul>
<li> <tt>seqm</tt> is wrong; <tt>seqa(10,0,3)</tt> is wrong
<li> <tt>"string"$x;</tt> didn't work
<li> loadd for dat or dht/dat datafile didn't work
<li> <tt>string * ones(r,c)</tt> was not allowed.
<li> improved <tt>dstat</tt>, <tt>scalerr</tt>, <tt>indcv</tt>, <tt>indices</tt>
<li> <tt>a[b[j]]</tt> type expressions could go wrong
<li> <tt>format</tt> with precision 0 didn't work
<li> <tt>load x,y;</tt> didn't work
<li> <tt>load</tt> at external level now also declares variables if necessary
<li> <tt>token(" ")</tt> would have index error
<li> added <tt>screen off; screen on;</tt>
<li> added <tt>ndpchk</tt>, <tt>ndpclex</tt>, <tt>ndpcntrl</tt> back in
<li> <tt>ismiss({})</tt> should return TRUE
<li> <tt>clear,clearg,close,declare,delete,external</tt>: separating , is optional
<li> quoted string with linebreaks was not treated correctly yet.
<li> ignoring Ctrl+Z (\x1a)
<li> <tt>save path=^spath AA;</tt> didn't work (aa would be OK)
<li> <tt>trace 0;</tt> skipped
<li> <tt>"aap" -noot;</tt> now allowed
<li> <tt>indices, indices2, import, ols</tt> 
<li> <tt>eqsolve, qnewton</tt>
<li> some more pgraph improvements
<li> following didn't work:<br>
		<tt>declare _penalt ?= 1;</tt><br>
		<tt>declare _penalt ?= 0;</tt>
<li> <tt>1./x</tt> now doesn't give warning anymore
<li> column_vector .^ row_vector is allowed
<li> implicit let with matrix dimensions now allowed, e.g.: <tt>m[2,2] = {1 2,3 4};</tt>
<li> undefined variable now treated as function unless followed
   by = or [. This allows (e.g.) forward reference to graphset
   or function without arguments.
<li> fixed bug with declaration of library variables when loading a
   library inside a function.
<li> <tt>declare</tt> and <tt>external</tt> now allowed inside function
<li> created autoloading of undefined functions (as .src, .g or .oxgauss)
<li> <tt>ftos</tt> didn't allow leading and trailing text;
<li> <tt>shiftr</tt> didn't shift left properly (negative shift)
<li> <tt>shiftr</tt> didn't do `tabular' version
<li> <tt>xpnd</tt> was wrong (not equivalent to unvech)
<li> <tt>load/loadd/loads</tt> had fclose missing
<li> <tt>0$+x</tt> didn't work of x was matrix with strings
<li> <tt>lnpdfn</tt> was wrong; added <tt>lnpdfnmvn</tt>
<li> load/loadm/loads/loadd now allow filename without extension
<li> some improvements in graphp: improved <tt>bar,hist,histp</tt>;
   added <tt>loglog,logx,logy</tt>; all graphs now shown in new windows
<li> <tt>load</tt> would only accept constant matrix dimensions
<li> ^Filename in <tt>load/save</tt> would not work because of uppercase
<li> <tt>declare matrix b, c;</tt> was not allowed, only single declaration.
<li> format always expected width,precision arguments
<li> <tt>proc(0) foo(a);</tt> would print 0.000 if called as: foo(a); instead of call foo(a);
<li> for loop would not work with negative increments
<li> <tt>x[1 ]</tt> would give error message (cause by space before ])
<li> <tt>x = 1; x[1] = 2;</tt> would give an error message:
   Runtime error: 'int' cannot index this type
<li> <tt>\000</tt> in a string was not recognized
<li> <tt>.NE/.LE/.GE</tt> didn't work, while <tt>.ne/.le/.ge</tt> did
<li> <tt>filesa,files</tt>

</ul>
</ul>
