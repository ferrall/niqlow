<h2>Ox: known problems in Ox 5.00</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;
</ul>

<h2>OxGauss</h2>
<ul>
<li>A bug has been identified in a procedure which
(1) calls as yet undefined procedures,
(2) includes two or more for loops. In that case, the second
(and further) loop incrementation can go awry. The reason is that
there is insufficient space for the loop-local variables on the stack.
<p>
The following example is a minimal example:
<xmp>
/*external proc unknown;*/
test();
end;
proc(0) = test();
    unknown();
    for f (1,6,1);
        f;
    endfor;
    for d (1,6,1);
        d;
    endfor;
endp;
proc(0)=unknown();
endp;
</xmp>
Until this is fixed in Ox, the problem can be avoided by ensuring that
there are no undeclared functions. In the example above that means:
(1) adding the line<br>
<tt>external proc unknown;</tt><br>
at the top, or moving <tt>unknown</tt> to above test.

</ul>
