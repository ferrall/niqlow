<hr><h2>Fixed problems in version 5.1</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>OxPack cannot run modelling package that depends on files outside
	  the implied package folder: need option to specify additional run options.
	  Redesigned the Add/Remove Package dialog.

<li>Ability to read csv file written by Excel on Mac.
Save csv file: no more warning about maximum rows/columns.
The <tt>loadmat</tt>/<tt>savemat</tt> documentation now mentions csv
(the wks/wk1 formats are now deprecated).
<p>
<i>Warning: Excel may write csv files with only single precision (9 significant
digits, rather than the 17 that are needed for loss-less saving).
</i>

<li><tt>DrawTMatrix</tt> and daily data: sub sample plotting picked an upper bound for the x-axis that was
      too low when using annual major ticks. Now also extending axis one day further, to include
	  the next major tick mark on the axis.

<li>Fixed memory leak in <tt>choleski</tt> of large matrices

<li><tt>DrawBoxPlot</tt>: third argument was not interpreted as
      variable name but as line index.

<li><tt>Modelbase::Grow</tt> creates wrong Seasonal/CSeasonal for
      weekly data.

<li>Couldn't use <tt>GetModelStatus()</tt> in PcFiml derived classes.

<li>Examples (html): title had link back, but now also added
	  definition at end of example to jump to definition.

<li><tt>Companion()</tt> (in <tt>lib/longrun.ox</tt>) would give run-time error
	  for static model.

<li>Found solution for annoying Internet Explorer ActiveX
	  warning with Ox html files

<li>bin64/oxl.exe was not statically linked

<li>Fixed crash in <tt>loadmat</tt> of non-existent .xls file

<li>Increased precision of today function (Windows,Linux);
	  timer under Linux now returns wallclock instead of CPU time (as in Windows).

</ul>

<a name="v500_new"></a>
<hr><h2>New features and enhancements in version 5.0</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Multithreaded version (Ox Professional only)

New command line option <tt>-rp</tt> to specify number of parallel threads.
The default is to use the same as the number of cores/processors.
Use <tt>-rp1</tt> to force running on just one (serial instead of parallel).

<li>Can now have <tt>enum</tt> inside class declaration (behaving as
	  <tt>static const decl</tt> member variables).

<li>Can now declare the same class twice (e.g. by accidentally
	  including a header file twice, provided the declarations are identical)

<li><tt>Modelbase::ForceYlag</tt> changed all types to <tt>Y_VAR</tt> for lagged
      Y variables. Now argument can be array of two values to specify which type
	  to change (first is value to change to, second to change from).
	  <tt>Modelbase::ReceiveModel()</tt> now only changes <tt>X_VAR</tt>
	  to <tt>Y_VAR</tt> for lagged dep.vars using
	  <tt>ForceYlag( {Y_VAR, X_VAR} );</tt>

<li><tt>ismember</tt> and <tt>classname</tt> functions.

<li>improved <tt>invertgen</tt> documentation.

<li><tt>Database::Grow</tt> and <tt>Modelbase::Grow</tt> now accept a negative
argument to add observations at the beginning. Improved the created dates
when extending a dated (weekly or 5 days per week) database.

<li><tt>Database::Remove</tt> and <tt>Database::Rename</tt> now accept arrays of strings
      as arguments.

<li><tt>dropr</tt> and <tt>insertr</tt> now also work on arrays.

<li><tt>getfiles</tt> function

<li>OxPack:
<ul>
<li>    Added <tt>"OxPackGetData"("DbFullPath")</tt>
<li>	  Can now specify multiple extensions in OP_FILE_OPEN, e.g.
	    <tt>"OxPackSpecialDialog"("OP_FILE_OPEN", 0, "*.in7;*.xls"</tt>
<li>      Added <tt>OP_VARIABLE</tt> (OxPackSpecialDialog) and <tt>CTL_VARIABLE</tt>
      (dialog control). This allows editing any Ox variable, including
	  arrays and objects of classes. The type of components cannot be changed.
</ul>

<li>Now can take the reference (address) of const variables
      (previously this would be a compile-time error).
	  This allows using <tt>fscan("%v", &this)</tt> to read an object from disk. Also
	  allowed is &this in <tt>OP_VARIABLE</tt> or <tt>CTL_VARIABLE</tt>.

<li>Faster sorting functions

<li><tt>exclusion</tt> function with 3 arguments now sets idx to <>
      if the input is empty

<li>improvements for <tt>quanbeta</tt> and <tt>quanf</tt>, <tt>probf</tt>, <tt>tailf</tt>
now allows n,m&gt;0
	  instead of n,m&gt;1.

</ul>

<a name="v500_fix"></a>
<hr><h2>Fixed problems in version 5.0:</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li><tt>"%v"</tt> format: don't read/write static const members.

<li><tt>public static</tt> data members were not directly accessible.

<li>In Ox 4 <tt>ranseed</tt> returns the 256 seeds. However, the
      generator has an additional state and carry integer, so this is not
	  enough to get the exact state of the generator. Now <tt>ranseed</tt> will
	  return 258 numbers: the 256 seeds followed by state and carry.
	  This allows for the exact state to be replicated (defaults are
	  used for seeds, state or carry that are missing). 

<li><tt>raninvgaussian</tt> could generate negative draws for very large mu,
	  e.g. raninvgaussian(1,1,1e10,0.53).
	  This was a problem with the original algorithm (Michael et al. 1976).

<li>Parser recognizes &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;, however they could cause
      stack overflow (and subsequent crash). Now solved stack problem.
	  Currently, it is a no-op: doesn't do anything.

<li>The following code
<xmp>
		Get() {	return {"AA"}; 			}
		main(){	println(Get()[<0,0>]);	}
</xmp>
	  prints
<xmp>
		[0] = AA
		[1] = 0
</xmp>
	  instead of
<xmp>
		[0] = AA
		[1] = AA
</xmp>
	  
<li><tt>modelforc</tt> crashed after error message: Some lagged variables
	  are not given at lag 0.
	  Now better at taking zero coefficients in account.

<li><tt>gammafact(.NaN)</tt> results in crash (infinite recursion) on Linux.

<li>The <tt>spline</tt> function with specified <i>X</i> and missing value(s)
      would crash. To fix this, the return value of the spline function
	  when an <i>X</i> variable is specified is different: previously it was the
	  sorted smooth values. Now the values are in the original position
	  (i.e. corresponding to the input <i>Y</i> data).<br>
	  Spline against time was unaffected and is unchanged.
	  
<li>OxPack:
<ul>
<li>	  <tt>SaveOptions</tt> did not get called when closing OxMetrics.
<li>	  <tt>CTL_LABEL</tt> should not affect the column partitioning.
</ul>

<li><tt>DrawTMatrix</tt> with dates for X axis did not work in Ox Console
      (but worked with OxMetrics).


</ul>
