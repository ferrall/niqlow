<hr><h1>Ox 2.10: new features and fixes</h1>

<hr><h2>New features and enhancements</h2>
<ul>

<li>Created <a href="oxstd.html#iseq"><tt>iseq()</tt></a>.
Now can use <a href="oxstd.html#isfeq"><tt>isfeq()</tt></a> for case-insensitive
string comparison. Also created <a href="oxstd.html#strifind"><tt>strifind()</tt></a>
as case-insensitive version of <a href="oxstd.html#strfind"><tt>strfind()</tt></a>.

<li><tt>"aa"+"bb"</tt> is now the same as <tt>"aa"~"bb"</tt> 

<li>Allowing <i>k</i> <tt>x</tt> <i>T</i> input for:
<a href="oxdraw.html#DrawCorrelogram"><tt>DrawCorrelogram()</tt></a>,
<a href="oxdraw.html#DrawBoxPlot"><tt>DrawBoxPlot()</tt></a>,
<a href="oxdraw.html#DrawSpectrum"><tt>DrawSpectrum()</tt></a>,
<a href="oxdraw.html#DrawQQ"><tt>DrawQQ()</tt></a>,
<a href="oxdraw.html#DrawDensity"><tt>DrawDensity()</tt></a>
Also created 2 argument <a href="oxdraw.html#Draw"><tt>Draw()</tt></a> function.

<li>created:<br>
<a href="oxclass.html#Database::Load"><tt>Database::Load</tt></a>,<br>
<a href="oxclass.html#Sample::GetFrequency"><tt>Sample::GetFrequency</tt></a>, and<br>
<a href="oxclass.html#Database::RemoveObsIf"><tt>Database::RemoveObsIf</tt></a>,<br>

<li><a href="oxclass.html#Modelbase">Modelbase class</a>

<li>Read Stata 4-6 .dta files (<a href="oxstd.html#loadmat"><tt>loadmat</tt></a>,
<a href="oxclass.html#Database::LoadDta"><tt>Database::LoadDta</tt></a>)

<li>The comma in a matrix constant to seperate elements within
a row was made optional in Ox 2.00. However, this could lead to
to errors which are difficult to find, and has been made compulsary again.

<li>Other new and enhanced functions:

<ul>
<li><a href="oxstd.html#cerf"><tt>cerf()</tt></a> (Complex error function)
<li><a href="oxstd.html#erf"><tt>erf()</tt></a> (Error function)
<li><a href="oxpackages.html#randirichlet"><tt>randirichlet()</tt></a>,
<li><a href="oxpackages.html#ranwishart"><tt>ranwishart()</tt></a>

<li><a href="oxstd.html#today"><tt>today()</tt></a> to get current time/date as double (no of secs since 1970).<br>
<a href="oxstd.html#timing"><tt>timing</tt></a><tt>(mtimes,1)</tt> to go from doubles to year,month,...

<li><a href="oxpackages.html#NumJacobian"><tt>NumJacobian()</tt></a>: Now using vec in the returned function value,
so can be used for matrix-valued functions.
</ul>

<li>assignment of array to part of array (i.e. using selection on right-hand side)
now uses array contents of rhs.
Previously, when both as1 and as 2 are arrays (of strings e.g.)
<xmp>
    as1[0:1] = as2
</xmp>
was executed as
<xmp>
    as1[0] = as2, as1[1] = as2;
</xmp>
thus going up one array level in as1[0] and as1[1].
Now it is executed as:
<xmp>
    as1[0] = as2[0], as1[1] = as2[1];
</xmp>
thus preserving the array level in as1.
	
</ul>



<hr><h2>Known problems in version 2.00a which are fixed in version 2.10:</h2>

<ul>

<li>assignment using one index on the left-hand side doesn't
works as expected when the lhs is indexed as row (or column) and
the right-hand side is a column (or row). For example:
<xmp>
    decl vp = <1;2;3;4>;	
    vp[0:1] = <-1,-2>;	// WRONG!
    vp[0:1] = <-1;-2>;	// OK
</xmp>
The first should set vp to -1;-2;3;4, but only did -1;2;3;4.

<li>OxRun: GiveWin keeps grabbing focus when a new window is specified.
Now this is only happening the first time; the window is brought
to the foreground within GiveWin after SetTextWindow/SetDrawWindow, but
GiveWin grabs focus only first time.

<li><tt>&lt;0.1;0.7;&gt;</tt> would lead to an infite loop of error messages.
Now the trailing semicolon or colon is allowed.

<li>Error in PcFimlDgp.ox prevented use of more than one lag.

<li>Small improvement to XLS reading.
Also fixed problem with large negative numbers
(which were mapped to an integer by Excel).

<li>In rare occasions concatenation with a NULL string would lead to a crash.

<li><tt>Database::Remove()</tt> did not remove the variable name.

<li><tt>invertgen(x, 0)</tt> is wrong if x is not square.

<li>Bug in <tt>NumJacobian()</tt>: dimensions of returned matrix are wrong.

<li>
Problem with scanning from a string:
<tt>sscan(&s, ...)</tt> doesn't advance string correctly, resulting in a crash.
<tt>sscan(s, ...)</tt> only works for first scanned element
(again, the string location is not moved forward before reading
the second element). As a consequence, the example on page 187
will not work.

<li>
<tt>sortbyc()</tt> when sorting by multiple columns is likely
to go wrong. The only version which works is
when the sort column indices are of the form: 0,1,2,...
(i.e. starting at 0, and consecutive range).

</ul>


<hr><h2>Known problems in version 2.00 which were fixed in version 2.00a:</h2>

<ul>

<li>There is a problem with using [] directly on the return value
of a function when the function returns an array. Also when a function
returns part of an array which resides in a local variable. For example:
<xmp>
    func1()
    {   return {"a", "b"};
    }
    print(func1()[1]);
    func2()
    {   decl x = {"a", "b"};
        return x[0:1];
    }
    print(func2());
</xmp>
In the first case <tt>x=func1()</tt> is fine. In the second case,
assigning <tt>x[0:1]</tt> to a local variable which is then returned
works without problems.
        
        
<li>Saving as in7: base name with more than 12 chars causes problems
(when trying to derive default project name) and could result in a crash.
Can be avoided by using a base name (ie. file name without path and extension)
with fewer than 13 characters.

<li> <tt>a[0][x] * b[x][1]</tt> crashes, but only when the first dimension
of <tt>a</tt> is 0 and the second dimension of <tt>b</tt> is 1.

<li>Problem with reassigning different zero sized matrix. For example:
<xmp>
    decl x = zeros(0,5);
    println(rows(x), " x ", columns(x));
    x = zeros(0,6);
    println(rows(x), " x ", columns(x));
</xmp>
prints:
<xmp>
    0 x 5
    0 x 5
</xmp>
but should be
<xmp>
    0 x 5
    0 x 6
</xmp>

</ul>
