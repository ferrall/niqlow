<H1>Ox: Fixes and new features in version 1.10</H1>
<HR>
<H2>New features and remarks, version 1.10</H2>
<ul>
<li>Added two compiler warnings, see
<a href="doc/ox/ox.html#ox_over_switch">Ox command line options</a>.

<li>Improved OxRun: better run-time error handling, now allows
command-line arguments, better naming of GiveWin windows opened by OxRun.

<li>OX_BIG_ENDIAN and OX_Windows (etc.) constants, see
<a href="doc/ox/oxconst.html">Predefined Constants</a>;
created oxversion().

<li>Created armaforc(), armafit(), cumsum(), cumprod()
<li>Changed input of polyroots
(<em>please note, this is a change from version 1.08: now the constant
is included in the input polynomial</em>), created polymake(), polydiv()

<li>Online documentation in HTML format.

<li> now allows <tt>double("tinker")</tt> and <tt>string(double("tinker"))</tt>

<li>fopen: default is now reading
(<em>please note, this is a change from version 1.08</em>).

<li>I/O functions: fscan(), scan(), sscan(), fread(), fwrite(), fseek()

<li>Created tabular operators, also allowing matrix[1][1] dot-op matrix
and the reverse.

<li>Changed rann() to fill matrix by rows, old version is still available
as ranno(). <em>Please note, this is a change from version 1.08:
since the matrix is filled differently, results will differ
from version 1.08</em>. (The current version is faster.)

<li>Added reshape()
</ul>

<H2>Fixed bugs in version 1.10</H2>
<ul>
<li>There is a potential bug when using
member functions as argument to other procedures, such as e.g.
the maximization or numerical derivative functions.

<li>Range check for matrix indices did not check whether
the lower bound is above the matrix size
(e.g. m[][10:] in 8 x 8 matrix).

<li>Out of range error message has first and
second index of error reversed.

<li>GiveWin gets in an infinite loop when
the first area for graphics is not number 0.

</ul>
