<hr><h1>Ox 3.10: new features and fixes</h1>


<hr><h2>New features and enhancements</h2>
<p>

<ul>
<li>Updated Basic examples to Visual Basic 6. Updated
ox/dev/OxWin.bas, and created ox/dev/OxGiveWin.bas for link to GiveWin.
<li>checked Borland version of threes.c.

<li>Updated OxPack documentation in Appendix

<li>Updated exported function list in Appendix.

<li>Put the Imhof code in ox/lib/probimhof.ox

<li>Online help: added all the examples of the standard function library.

<li>Added "%lwr" to print only lower diagonal. For example:
<tt>print("%lwr", x);</tt>

<li>added isdotmissing/ismissing (test for NaN or infinity).

<li>Added ADJ_LEGEND for DrawAdjust.

<li>Improved number of columns per line when using "%cf" print format.
</ul>


<hr><h2>Problems in version 3.00 which have been fixed in version 3.10:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Online help: GetDbName/SetDbName should be in Modelbase

<li>Improved timer function under Linux.
  
<li>Matrix multiplication is slow:
some left-in debugging code resulted in the multiplication
done twice (once slowly, once quickly, so slow overall!). This
would be noticeable when working with large matrices.
<li>Fixed problem with the contour plots in DrawXYZ.

<li>SolveQP with bounds only didn't work; didn't
	   always handle bounds correctly.
(NB. this SolveQP is very slow on larger problems. A new
version is under development.)

<li>Docs: default for dMin argument of DrawHistogram is 1, not 0.

<li>OxGauss: gradp returned result transposed.

<li>Reading version 2.1 .xls files: integers beween
       32000 and 64000 are read as negative numbers (not a problem
	   for version 3 or more recent Excel files; note that Ox
	   never saves an .xls file with integers).

<li>Saving as in7 file: didn't check for spaces (could
	be problem, e.g., when loading from .xls, and then saving).
	The .in7 file with spaces in variable names would not load
	properly, suggesting a corrupted file. However, the data (.bn7 file)
	was intact, and the .in7 file (which is a text file), can
	be easily fixed.
</ul>
