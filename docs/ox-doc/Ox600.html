The Ox version number is kept in line with the OxMetrics front-end version.

<hr><h2>Fixed problems in version 6.3</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: When running Ox code in OxMetrics: call to SaveDrawWindow could crash
      under Linux and OSX.

<li>Fixed: reading of csv with one column and no label treats first
      number as label: now read as unlabelled.

<li>Fixed: reading "%C" format using <tt>sscan</tt>/<tt>fscan</tt> did not always work correctly.
	
<li>Fixed: xlsx: empty cell (i.e. specified cell without content) would be read as zero.
	
<li>Fixed: <tt>static virtual</tt> and <tt>virtual static</tt> now flagged as error.
	
<li>Improved: <tt>DrawTitle(i, "");</tt> now removes the existing title.
</ul>	  

<a name="v621_new"></a>
<hr><h2>Fixed problems in version 6.21</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: problem using <tt>for(;;)</tt> when it is the first statement
      in a function (i.e. there are only declarations without assignments before it).
<li>Fixed: A scan format using * to suppress assignment of the read
	  variable did not work for matrix or token types.
<li>Fixed: problem using public static variables in base class,
	  which are accessed via an object of a derived class.
<xmp>	  
	class Ca
	{
	public:
		static decl sm_a;
		static Set_a(const a);
	}
	Ca::Set_a(const a) { sm_a = a; }
	class Cb : Ca { }
</xmp>	  
	  The first two approaches did not work for a derived class when using static variables in the base class:
<ol>	  
<li>Public access through an object	did not work:
<xmp>	  
	  	 decl obj = new Cb();
		 obj.sm_a = 10;
</xmp>	  
<li>Printing an object directly or using <tt>"%v"</tt>	did not work:
<xmp>	  
	  	 println(obj, "%v", obj);
</xmp>	  
<li>Access through an object using a `getter' function worked fine:
<xmp>	  
    	 obj.Set_a(10);
</xmp>	  
<li>Access using the class directly worked fine:
<xmp>	  
	     Cb::sm_a = 10;
</xmp>	  
<li>Access using the class and a static `getter' function worked fine:
<xmp>	  
		 Cb::Set_a(10);
</xmp>
Note that 4 and 5 are more efficient than 1 and 3, because the variable can be resolved
at compile time.
</ol>	  
</ul>

<hr><h2>New features and fixed problems in version 6.2</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>New: Added <tt>hyper_2F1(a, b, c, z)</tt> to compute the Gauss Hypergeometric
function <sub>2</sub><i>F</i><sub>1</sub> with real parameters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and real argument <i>z</i>.
<li>Improved: <tt>exit</tt> now exits with the specified return code (in a console)
<li>Improved: <tt>polygamma</tt> now allows negative arguments
<li>Improved: xlsx: allow reading of strings created through a formula
<li>Improved: xlsm can be read as xlsx
<li>Fixed: Save graph as PDF: hats on symbols showed next to the symbol; large ellipses were squeezed in the middle.
<li>Fixed: xlsx: column labelling error when &gt; 26 columns. Reading
      file written by OxMetrics works, but there are gaps. Reading file written
      in Excel will result in skipped columns.
<li>Fixed: There was a bug in some quantile functions that could lead to return of wrong value
    in some rare cases.	This could affect quantiles of F, Beta and Inverse Gaussian.
<li>Fixed: Chrome/Safari/Opera frame loading fixed (was entering infinite
	reload loop). Improved default browser detection under Windows.
	Improved Chrome/Safari jumping to help item.
</ul>

<a name="v610_new"></a>
<hr><h2>New features and fixed problems in version 6.1</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>New: Added read and write support for Excel xlsx files.
Added read (113,114) and write (114) support for Stata 11 .dta files.

<li>New: Added PDF as new save format for graphics.

<li>Changed: Now using thinner symbols on very thick lines in plots.

<li>Fixed: PostScript BWG did not obey BWG line types

<li>Fixed: <tt>dev/.../Makefile</tt> files were missing from the installation.

<li>Fixed: <tt>SetTextWindow</tt> could appear to be delayed relative
      to the output, so output from the previous window could show in the
	  new one.

<li>Fixed: This wouldn't work from OxRun (from draw4.ox):
	    ShowDrawWindow();                 // show this concoction
	    SaveDrawWindow("draw4.gwg");
	    SaveDrawWindow("draw4.eps");
	  The second graph would not be created, and would create an empty draw4 window.
</ul>

<a name="v600_new"></a>
<hr><h2>New features and enhancements in version 6.0</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>
<li>Added <tt>QQ_N_SE</tt> for <tt>DrawQQ</tt>: pointwise asymptotic Std.Error bands
	  on normal QQ-plots.

<li>Recession shading line style (style constant is <tt>ST_SHADING</tt>;
shading is on when the variable has value 1, off otherwise).

<li>oxdraw.h: defining ST_

<li>Introduced oxo version (separate from Ox version), current
	  version is 5 (unchanged from Ox 5 to Ox 6). When the oxo version changes, .oxo
	  files must be recompiled.

</ul>

<a name="v600_fix"></a>
<hr><h2>Fixed problems in version 6.0:</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li>OxPack: fixed potential issue in <tt>"OxPackSpecialDialog"("OP_VARIABLE",...</tt>

<li>Repeatedly running an Ox file that saves a graph could
	  result in multiple instances of the same graphics files being open in
	  OxMetrics (asking for a reload every time it changes).

<li>The following code would leak memory:
<xmp>
		fn()
		{
			decl logdet = rann(100000, 100);
			invertsym(2 * unit(2), &logdet);
		}
</xmp>
	  Because <tt>invertsym</tt> wouldn't free before assigning. This applies to a few
	  library functions that return an integer or double through an argument
	  (and was only likely if a variable was reused).

<li>PcFiml class lacked GetResVar() (virtual from Modelbase)

<li><tt>DrawAdjust</tt> doesn't work for <tt>DrawDensity</tt> because the title
      is drawn after the density.

<li><tt>MaxSQP(F)</tt>: didn't return <tt>MAX_MAXIT</tt> if max reached;
      rounding errors on Hi/Low bounds could push parameters outside bounds by a tiny bit.

</ul>
