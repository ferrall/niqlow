<hr><h1>Ox 2.20: new features and fixes</h1>

<hr><h2>New features and enhancements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minor adjustment to GiveWin for Windows 2000.
<li>OxPack with always on top option. Now installed with Ox Professional
in <tt>ox\bin</tt>.
<li><tt>invertgen(.,30)</tt> now distinguishes between singular
       and negative definite matrix.
<li><tt>sortc</tt> of <i>T</i> <tt>x</tt> 1 matrix now same speed as <tt>sortr</tt>.
</ul>



<hr><h2>Problems in version 2.10 which have been fixed in version 2.20:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in OxMainCmd which affected the Visual Basic RanApp example.
<li>Assigning member functions to a variable
       could lead to problems if reassignment of the variable
	   to another member function is made.
<li>Modelbase: keeping sign on t-values.
<li>automatic creation of backup files when saving data has been removed.
<li><tt>sscan</tt> with %c format could return too much text.
<li>Spreadsheets: now writing "#N/A" for missing values
  in Excel files; @NA in Lotus 1-2-3 files.
<li>Problem with reading dates from data.xls:
	   doesn't pick up dates when date column is unlabelled.
<li>Compile only: returns exit code !0
<li><tt>choleski</tt>(): doesn't return 0 when decomposition fails.
	   Also made <tt>choleski</tt>() fail at same point as <tt>decldl</tt>():
	   checking <tt>a[i][i]</tt> rather than <tt>sqrt(a[i][i])</tt>.
<li>PcFiml class <tt>Chow</tt>(): if break-point beyond sample: would
give .NaN because <tt>m_dLogLik</tt> was cleared by Modelbase::<tt>SetSelSample</tt>().
<li>Note: QuadPack is compiled FORTRAN. Consequently call backs are
non-re-entrant,	and a QuadPack function cannot call the same function.
However, now it can call a different QuadPack function, allowing for 
double integrals.
<li>Database class: Lagged seasonals are actually leads,
so: Season_1 is Q4, Season_2 is Q3, Season_3 is Q2.
<li>Removed artificial upper limit on line length (format function).
<li>DrawTitle doesn't replace an existing title. Fixed in GiveWin.
<li>When starting OxRun from GiveWin, it may loose the last section
of output.
<li>Small fix in lib/longrun
</ul>
