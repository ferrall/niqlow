<p>
<hr><h2>New features and enhancements in version 7.1</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> OS X
<ul>
<li>command line version of Ox Professional now is 64-bit and multi-threaded, so supporting parallel loops.
Note that the Ox version called from OxMetrics
and OxRun is still 32-bit, because the GUI is still 32-bit.
<li>OxMetrics now disables AppNapp for OxModel, OxPack and OxRun at start-up.
</ul>

<li>Handling of computations involving empty matrices improved to be more intuitive.
(Some of these changes may impact existing code.)
<ul>
<li><tt>x*y'</tt> returns <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> if y is empty (to conform to x*z when z is empty),
		previously it gave a run-time error;
<li><tt>outer(&lt;&gt;,y)</tt> returns <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> (rather than give a run-time error)
<li><tt>determinant(&lt;&gt;)</tt> returns 0
<li><tt>logdet(&lt;&gt;)</tt> returns <tt>-.Inf</tt> with signdet 0
<li><tt>logdet</tt>(singular matrix) returns <tt>-.Inf</tt> with signdet 0 (was 1 with signdet 0)
<li><tt>shape(x, y, r, c)</tt> and <tt>reshape(x, y, r, c)</tt> return an r x c matrix of zeros when x or y is empty or r,c is zero.
<li><tt>nullspace(&lt;&gt;)</tt> returns <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt>, <tt>nullspace</tt>(full rank m x m) returns zeros(m,0), nullspace(zeros(m,0)) returns
an identity matrix.
</ul>

<li>Linux:
<ul>
<li>Removed linux GLIBC dependencies on version 2.14 and 2.17 (Debian Wheezy is
        still on 2.13 while RHEL 6 is on 2.12).
<li>Removed dependency on GLIBCXX_3.4.14.

<li>OxMetrics was using the user locale, instead of the C locale.
		For many languages, this meant using the , as decimal separator instead of the .
		This in turn messed up display and saving of floating point numbers.
		Now using the C locale, as the console versions already did.

<li>Producing some debian packages for installation now as well.

</ul>

<li> Now can use lambda function in callback (<tt>FOxRunCallBack</tt>)

<li> `Warning: assignment in test expression' now <i>not</i> given if assignment is in parenthesis:
		if (a = b) gives warning
		if ((a = b)) and if ((a = c) &gt;= 0) do not give warnings anymore.

<li><tt>MaxSQP/MaxSQPF</tt>: hi,lo parameters can be scalar: in that case same value is used for all parameters.

<li> Improved decisions when to do A*B and A'B in parallel.

<li><tt>rank</tt>() could create run-time error when matrix has missing values.
        Now a warning, returning rank 0.

<li>New responsive html help (using iframes instead of frames).		

</ul>

<hr><h2>Fixed problems in version 7.1:</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li>OSX OxEdit Add/Remove Modules/Load From: crash. 

<li><tt>foreach</tt> loops on arrays were accessing the items by reference rather
		than value. This could lead to errors when the array item is changed in the loop, such as:
<xmp>		
			decl amres_hs = {1,unit(2),unit(3)}, h, i, j;
			foreach (h in amres_hs[i])
			{
				amres_hs[i] = h + i * 10;
				h += 1;
				println(">>h?", h);
			}
			println(amres_hs);
</xmp>
		This is now safe.
	
<li><tt>foreach</tt> was not allowed on variables that were const or serial. The following
		resulted in compilation error: 'amH' cannot take reference of constant:
<xmp>		
			decl jac_alphabeta = [=](const amH)
			{
				decl mj = <>, h, i;
				foreach (h in amH[i])
				{
				}
			};
</xmp>

<li><tt>MaxSQP/MaxSQPF</tt> if error in argument, would just print function name
		rather than the full run-time error message before stopping
	
<li> <tt>j = sscan("AA:5", "%*t", ":", "%d", &i);</tt> should have j=1 (not j=2)
        %* means skip the assignment, and such fields should not be counted. They were,
		however, for %t,%v,%C.

<li> If a data member of an object holds a function reference, this would be called
        with the wrong number of arguments, leading to a runtime error.

<li> <tt>find</tt> when searching for a string inside an array: defaulted to
		reverse search and ignored mode argument. When searching for a string inside a string
		it was always using reverse search, regardless of the mode.

<li> Base class in class declaration did not handle namespace correctly.
	Now in
<xmp>	
		class A : B { ... }
</xmp>	
	B defaults to the namespace in which it resides (or ::B for the global namespace,
	or N::B for namespace N if in the global namespace).

<li> <tt>clone</tt> was not preserving the pubic flag when copying an array (making it by value).
If a member was an object, <tt>clone</tt> would lose its public or static property
		after copying the object.

<li> <tt>Database::FindSelection</tt> should not give an error message when a variable is not found

<li> Problem with println("S\xF8ren"); and println("S&oslash;ren");
<ul>
	<li>On the Windows console: depends on the active code page (chcp).
	<li>in OxEdit: skips quite a bit of output after that. 
</ul>
	Can make the Windows console UTF-8 by using chcp 65001 and the Lucinda Console font, then correct in both.
	So best solution is for OxEdit/OxMetrics to treat all files with upper ASCII as UTF-8, not just
	files with characters &gt; 0xFF.

<li> A <tt>do {...}</tt> while loop as the very first executable code in a function can go wrong
		because an invalid optimization makes the returning jump statement out by one
		position in the code. Example:
<xmp>		
			#include <oxstd.h>
			test(a, c)
			{
				decl b;//;=0;
				do {  b = a;  ++c; 	} while (c < 0);
				println(b);
			}
			main()
			{
				test(10, -2);
			}	
</xmp>		
		 prints 1 instead of 10.<br>
		 If the first statement is <tt>decl b = 0;</tt>, then there is executable
		 code before the do statement, and the issue does not arise.
	 
<li> An indexation error in a function call argument would be reported at the wrong location.

<li> OS X OxEdit packaging error: has RunOnce with both files.

<li> If the number of arguments of a function declaration does not match a previous
		declaration, it could crash Ox, rather than give a compilation error.

<li> <tt>replace("%", "", "_");</tt> gets stuck in infinite loop

<li> static member variables could lead to a crash when an object was used in a
		parallel loop (solved by creating a new global lock).

<li> Refactoring of gamma function code, small change in DGammaRatio_22.

<li>Autometrics: Backward elimination did not consider the empty model.
</ul>
