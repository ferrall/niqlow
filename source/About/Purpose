/**  Purpose and Features.

<h2>Purpose of <span class="n">niqlow</span></h2>
<UL>
<LI><span class="n">niqlow</span> is a package to design, solve and estimate discrete dynamic programs.  The word <em>discrete</em> refers to several aspects of the framework: discrete time, discrete choice, and discrete/finite unobserved heterogeneity.</LI>

<LI>The package can be used by someone new to the area to learn how to map simple DP models to a program that will solve and estimate the model.</LI>

<LI><span class="n">niqlow</span> is also designed to be powerful and fast enough to serve as a research tool.	</LI>

<LI><a href="../examples/default.html">Programs</a> that replicate some output of models from the literature. By making replication and extension of existing models easier <span class="n">niqlow</span> may encourage more reliable and robust work in this area.
</UL>

<h2>Features</h2>
<UL>

<LI><span class="n">niqlow</span> uses an object-oriented approach.  This means, among other things, that a user creates their model using pre-defined Ox classes for actions, state variables, parameters and the DP problem itself.  This makes it possible to add and subtract elements of the model with minimal programming.

<LI>The DP problem can be integrated with the <a href="Optimization/default.html">Five-O</a> optimization code also included.</LI>

<LI>Estimation can account for finite mixture unobserved heterogeneity, based on either GMM on partially observed actions and states or MLE based on conditional choice probabilities.</LI>

<LI>It is possible to control for endogenous sample selection and <q>exogenous variation</q> (i.e. natural or designed experiments)</LI>

<LI>Works in parallel using the <a href="CFMPI/default.html">CFMPI</a> interface to OpenMPI (or other MPI implementations)</LI>
