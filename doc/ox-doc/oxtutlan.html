<h2><a name="ox_tutlan_intro"></a>Introduction</h2><p>

This chapter will give a brief overview of the important elements
of the Ox language.
A more formal description of the Ox syntax is in
the <a href="oxsyntax.html">syntax chapter</a>.

<p>
A more comprehensive tutorial introduction to the Ox language
is available as a <a href="OxIntro.pdf">separate book in
PDF format</a>. The accompanying tutorial programs are in the
<tt>ox\tutorial</tt> folder. The complete reference is:

</ul><p>
This is the recommended starting-point for learning the Ox language.


<p>
The next section will introduce the first Ox program,
showing how matrix are used.
We shall see that a program always includes header files to define
the standard library functions, and that it must have a <tt>main</tt>
function, which is where program control starts. We shall also see
that the body of the function is enclosed in curly braces.

<p>
<h2><a name="ox_tutlan_first"></a>A first Ox program</h2><p>

Ox is an object-oriented matrix language with a comprehensive
mathematical and statistical function library. Matrices can
be used directly in expressions, for example to multiply
two matrices, or to invert a matrix.
The basic syntax elements of Ox are similar to the C, C++ and
Java languages (however, knowledge if these
languages is not a prerequisite for using Ox).
This similarity is most clear in syntax items such as loops,
functions, arrays and classes.
A major difference is that Ox variables have no explicit type,
and that special support for matrices is available.

<p>
The advantages of object-oriented programming are that it
potentially improves the clarity and maintainability of the code,
as well as reducing coding effort through inheritance. Several
useful classes are provided with Ox.

<p>
As a first example of an Ox program consider the following Ox code:

<xmp>
#include <oxstd.oxh> // include Ox standard library header

main()              // function main is the starting point
{
    decl m1, m2;       // declare two variables, m1 and m2

    m1 = unit(3);  // assign to m1 a 3 x 3 identity matrix
    m1[0][0] = 2;             // set top-left element to 2
    m2 = <0,0,0;1,1,1>; // m2 is a 2 x 3 matrix, the first
              // row consists of zeros, the second of ones

    println("two matrices", m1, m2); // print the matrices
}
</xmp><p>

<p>
The program is in <tt>ox\samples\myfirst.ox</tt>;
running this program should produce the following result:

<xmp>
two matrices
       2.0000      0.00000      0.00000
      0.00000       1.0000      0.00000
      0.00000      0.00000       1.0000

      0.00000      0.00000      0.00000
       1.0000       1.0000       1.0000
</xmp><p>

<p>
An Ox program consists of one or more <i>source code</i> files.
All source files have the <tt>.ox</tt> extension. Header
files are used to communicate declarations from
one source file to another. <i>Header files</i> have the <tt>.oxh</tt>
extension.
The next section explains how to run the Ox program on your
system. First we consider the <tt>myfirst.ox</tt> program in more detail:

<ul>
<li>
The first line includes the <tt>oxstd.oxh</tt> file into the
source code (literally: the contents of the file are inserted at
that point). This file contains the function declarations of the standard
library, so that the function calls can be checked for number of arguments.
The file name is between <tt>&lt;  ></tt>, indicating that the header file
came with the Ox program.
</li>
<li>
The function <tt>main</tt> is the starting point, and each program
is only allowed one such function. Even though <tt>main</tt>
has no arguments, it still requires <tt>()</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Variables may be declared by using the <tt>decl</tt> statement,
and have no type until the program is actually run.
</li>
<li>
<tt>unit</tt> is a standard library function, which creates an identity
matrix; here it is called with argument <tt>3</tt>.
The result is assigned to the variable <tt>m1</tt>.
The type of <tt>m1</tt> has become <em>matrix</em>, and until a reassignment
is made (or it goes out of scope), <tt>m1</tt> will keep its type and value.
</li>
<li>Note that <em>indexing starts at zero</em>, so the top-left element
is <tt>m1[0][0]</tt>: row 0, column 0. The first index is the row index:
<tt>m1[1][2]</tt> is row 1, column 2.
Ox has this convention in common with many other programming
languages (but it could be changed, see
<a href="oxsyntax.html#ox_syntax_RefPrePragma"><tt>array_base</tt> pragma</a>,
this is not recommended).

<li>
<tt><0,0,0;1,1,1></tt> is a <em>matrix constant</em>. Elements are listed
by row, whereby rows are separated by a semicolon, and elements within
a row by a colon.
This value is stored in <tt>m2</tt>, which is now also
of type matrix.
</li>
<li>
<tt>println</tt> is a library function, which can print any type of
variable or constant to the standard output screen. It can take any
number of arguments. Here it has three: a <em>string constant</em> and
two variables (which both happen to be matrices).
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An important advantage of Ox is that we can directly work with
matrices, and do not have to worry about memory allocation and deallocation.
Low-level languages may be faster, although
we have encountered several cases in which Ox performed better
than a comparable C program. Ox code has a much closer correspondence
to mathematical expressions used on paper.

<p>
<details><summary><h2><a name="ox_tutlan_run"></a>Running the first Ox program</h2><p></p></summary>

<p><h3>Ox Professional under Windows</h3><p>

Load the <tt>myfirst.ox</tt> program in OxMetrics and click on Run
(the running person icon on the toolbar).
<p>
Or right-click on myfirst.ox in the workspace window
after it has een loaded into GiveWinn, and select <i>Run Ox</i>.

<p><h3>Ox Console under Windows</h3><p>

If Ox Console (or Ox Professional) has been installed correctly,
the Ox program can be run
from a command window (Command prompt or MS-DOS prompt under Windows)
by typing (this assumes Ox is installed in <tt>\Program Files\OxMetrics5\ox</tt> on the current drive):
<pre>
    cd &quot;\Program Files\OxMetrics5\ox\samples&quot;
</pre><p>
Followed by
<pre>
    oxl myfirst
</pre><p>
There is no need to add the .ox extension.
If <tt>oxl</tt> cannot be found, you have to add the path
to the executable file, which is in <tt>ox\bin</tt>:
<pre>
    ..\bin\oxl myfirst
</pre><p>

Having to add the path to <tt>oxl.exe</tt> everytime is a nuisance,
and there are several alternatives which are more convenient:
<ul>
<li>Add the <tt>ox\bin</tt> folder to the environment <tt>PATH</tt>.
In the default installation this is <tt>C:\Program Files\OxMetrics5\ox\bin</tt>.
<li>Use <b>OxEdit</b> to run your Ox programs.
<li>Ox Professional users can run their programs (with graphics)
from <b>OxMetrics</b>.
</ul><p>

In the remainder, we refer to the MS-DOS window as the console window,
and to <tt>oxl.exe</tt> as the console version of the Ox compiler.

<p><h3>Unix</h3><p>

If Ox has been installed correctly, the Ox program can be run
from a command window by typing (this assumes Ox is installed in <tt>/ox</tt>
on the current drive, which is unlikely to be the correct path):
<xmp>
    cd /ox/samples
</xmp><p>
Followed by
<xmp>
    oxl myfirst
</xmp><p>
There is no need to add the .ox extension.
Currently, there is only the console version under Unix.

If your output is:

<xmp>
    myfirst.ox (1): 'oxstd.oxh' include file not found
    myfirst.ox (7): 'unit' undeclared identifier
    myfirst.ox (12): 'print' undeclared identifier
</xmp><p>

Then the header file was not found, and the <tt>OX5PATH</tt>
environment variable is not set, or set wrongly. (Note that the
environment variable has been renamed from <tt>OX3PATH</tt>
to <tt>OX5PATH</tt> with version 4.)


<p><h3>Running programs with graphics</h3><p>

Several types of graphs are readily produced in Ox, such
as graphs over time of several variables, cross-plots,
histograms, correlograms, etc.
Although all graph saving will work on any system supported by Ox,
the result on screen will not always be identical.
<p>
A graph can be saved in various formats:
<dl>
<dd>encapsulated PostScript (<tt>.eps</tt>),
<dd>PostScript (<tt>.ps</tt>), and
<dd>PDF: Portable document format (<tt>.pdf</tt>),
<dd>OxMetrics graphics file (<tt>.gwg</tt>).
</dl>
<p>
When using <i>OxMetrics</i>, graphs can also be saved in Windows Metafile
format (<tt>.wmf</tt>), and copied to the clipboard for pasting
into wordprocessors.

<h4>Console graphics</h4><p>
Console versions of Ox can create graphs, and save them to disk.
However, they cannot display the graphs on screen. It is possible
to save the graph as PostScript, and then use GhostScript/GhostView
to view the graph.  There is also a GnuPlot package for Ox.


<h4>Windows graphics (<i>OxRun</i> and <i>OxMetrics</i>)</h4><p>

Text and graphics
output from the Ox program will appear in <i>OxMetrics</i>.
There, text and graphs can be edited further, or copied to the clipboard
for pasting into other programs.

<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_vars"></a>
<h2>Variables, types and scope</h2><p>
<p>
Variables are declared using the <tt>decl</tt> keyword. Unlike
C, variables are <em>implicitly</em> typed. This means that variables
do not have a type when they are declared, but get a type when
values are assigned to them. So a variable can change type during
its lifetime. The most important implicit types are <em>int</em>
for an integer value, <em>double</em> for a real number, <em>string</em>
for a text string and <em>matrix</em> for a matrix (two-dimensional array)
of real numbers.
The next Ox program illustrates implicit declaration and scope:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        decl i, d, m, s;
        i = 1;   // assign integer to i --&gt; i is of type int
        d = 1.0;  // assign real number to d --&gt; d is double
        s = &quot;some text&quot;;//assign string to s --&gt; s is string
        m = zeros(3,3);/ assign to m a 3 x 3 matrix of zeros
                                  // --&gt; m is of type matrix
        print(&quot;i=&quot;, i, &quot; d=&quot;, d, &quot; s=&quot;, s, &quot;\nm=&quot;, m);
    }
</pre><p>
This prints (<tt>\n</tt> is the newline character):
<p>
<pre>
    i=1 d=1 s=some text
    m=
          0.00000      0.00000      0.00000
          0.00000      0.00000      0.00000
          0.00000      0.00000      0.00000
</pre><p>
The <em>scope</em> of a variable refers to the parts of the program
which can see the variable. This could be different from its
lifetime: a variable can be `alive' but not `seen'. If a variable is
declared outside any function, its scope is the remainder of the source
file. It is possible to export such variables to other source files,
as we shall see shortly.
<p>
Variables declared inside a function have scope until the closing
brace of the level at which it is declared. The following example
illustrates:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    decl mX;                            // external variable
    main()
    {
        decl i = 0;                        // local variable
        {
           decl i = 1, j = 0;                       // new i
           mX = ones(3,3);
           print(&quot;i=&quot;, i, &quot; j=&quot;, j);      // prints: i=1 j=0
        }         // brace end: local i and j cease to exist
        print(&quot;\ni=&quot;, i);    // revert to old i, prints: i=0
    }
</pre><p>
The variable <tt>mX</tt> (here we use
<a href="#ox_tutlan_style">Hungarian notation</a>), can be seen everywhere in the <tt>main</tt>
function. To make sure that it can never be seen in
other source files, prefix it with the word <tt>static</tt>. It is
good programming practice to use <tt>static</tt> in such cases, because
it is very useful to know that it is not used in any other files
(we may than rename it, e.g., without any unexpected side effects).
An example will be given in <tt>myfunc.ox</tt> below.
<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_index"></a>
<h2>Indexing matrices</h2><p>
<p>
Indexing starts at zero, so <tt>m[0][0]</tt> is the first element
of the matrix <tt>m</tt>. It is easy to select individual elements
or a subset of the matrix. Here are some examples:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        decl m = &lt;0 1 2; 3 4 5; 6 7 8&gt;;
        println(&quot;m = &quot;, m);
        println(&quot;element 1,0: &quot;, m[1][0]);
        println(&quot;second row: &quot;,  m[1][]);
        println(&quot;second column: &quot;, m[][1]);
        println(&quot;without 1st row/3rd col: &quot;, m[1:][:1]);
        println(&quot;indexed as a vector &quot;, m[2:3]);
    }
</pre><p>
Which prints as output:
<pre>
m =
      0.00000       1.0000       2.0000
       3.0000       4.0000       5.0000
       6.0000       7.0000       8.0000
element 1,0: 3
second row:
       3.0000       4.0000       5.0000
second column:
       1.0000
       4.0000
       7.0000
without 1st row/3rd col:
       3.0000       4.0000
       6.0000       7.0000
indexed as a vector
       2.0000
       3.0000
</pre><p>
These expressions may also be used in assignments, for example:
<p>
<pre>
    m[1:][:1] = 10;
    m[2:3] = m[6:7];
</pre><p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_func"></a>
<h2>Functions and function arguments</h2><p>
<p>
We have already used various functions from the standard
library (such as <tt>print</tt>, <tt>ones</tt> and <tt>zeros</tt>), and written
various <tt>main</tt> functions).
Indeed, an Ox program is primarily a collection of functions.
It is important to know that all function arguments are <em>passed by
value</em>. This means that the function gets a copy which it can
change without changing the original. For example:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    func(mA)
    {
        mA = zeros(1,2);
        print(&quot;ma in func()&quot;, mA);
    }
    main()
    {
        decl ma;
        ma = ones(1,2);
        print(&quot;ma before func()&quot;, ma);
        func(ma);
        print(&quot;ma after func()&quot;, ma);
    }
</pre><p>
which prints:
<p>
<pre>
    ma before func()
           1.0000       1.0000
    ma in func()
          0.00000      0.00000
    ma after func()
           1.0000       1.0000
</pre><p>
If the function argument is not changed by the function, it
is good programming style to prefix it with the <tt>const</tt>
keyword, as in:
<p>
<pre>
    func(const mA)
    {
        print(&quot;ma in func()&quot;, mA);
    }
</pre><p>
Of course it is possible to return changed values from the function.
If there is only one return value, this is most simply done by
using the <tt>return</tt> statement:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    func(const r, const c)
    {
        return rann(r, c);      // return r x c matrix of random
    }                            // numbers from standard normal
    main()
    {
        print(&quot;return value from func():&quot;, func(1,2) );
    }
</pre><p>
Another way is to pass a <em>reference</em>
to the variable, rather than the variable itself, as for example in:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    func(const pmA)
    {
        pmA[0] = zeros(1,2);
        print(&quot;ma in func()&quot;, pmA[0]);
    }
    main()
    {
        decl ma;
        ma = ones(1,2);
        print(&quot;ma before func()&quot;, ma);
        func(&amp;ma);
        print(&quot;ma after func()&quot;, ma);
    }
</pre><p>
which prints:
<p>
<pre>
ma before func()
       1.0000       1.0000
ma in func()
      0.00000      0.00000
ma after func()
      0.00000      0.00000
</pre><p>
Now the change to <tt>ma</tt> is permanent. The argument
to the function was the address of <tt>ma</tt>, and
<tt>func</tt> received that address as a reference. Now we can modify
the contents of the reference by assigning a value to <tt>pmA[0]</tt>.
When <tt>func</tt> has finished, <tt>ma</tt> has been changed permanently.
Note that we gave the argument a <tt>const</tt> qualification.
This was possible because we did not change <tt>pmA</tt> itself,
but what it referred to.
<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_loop"></a>
<h2>The <tt>for</tt> and <tt>while</tt> loops</h2><p>
<p>
Since Ox is a matrix language, there is much less need for
loop statements than in C or C++. Indeed, because Ox is compiled
and then interpreted, there is a speed penalty for using
loop statements when they are not necessary.
<p>
The <tt>for</tt>, <tt>while</tt> and <tt>do while</tt> loops have the same syntax as
in C. The <tt>for</tt> loop consists of three parts,
an initialization part, a termination check, and an incrementation
part. The <tt>while</tt> loops only have a termination check.
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        decl i, d;
        for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i)
        {
            d = i * 0.01;
            println(d);
        }
    }
</pre><p>
which prints (<tt>println</tt> is like <tt>print</tt>, but ensures that the next
output will be starting on a new line):
<p>
<pre>
    0
    0.01
    0.02
    0.03
    0.04
</pre><p>
This could also be written, less elegantly, using <tt>while</tt> as follows:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        decl i, d;
        i = 0;
        while (i &lt; 5)
        {
            d = i * 0.01;
            println(d);
            ++i;
        }
    }
</pre><p>
It is not uncommon to have more than one loop counter
in the <tt>for</tt> statement, as
the following code snippet illustrates:
<p>
<pre>
    decl i, j;
    for (i = 0, j = 10; i &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; j &gt; 0; ++i, --j)
        println(i * j);
</pre><p>
The <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt> is <em>logical-and</em>, whereas <tt>||</tt> is <em>logical-or</em>.
The <tt>++i</tt> statement is called (prefix) incrementation, and means
`add one to <tt>i</tt>'. Similarly, <tt>--j</tt> subtracts one from <tt>j</tt>.
There is a difference between prefix and postfix incrementation
(decrementation). For example, the second line in
<p>
<pre>
    i = 3;
    j = ++i;
</pre><p>
means: add one to <tt>i</tt>, and assign the result
to <tt>j</tt>, which will get the value 4. But
<p>
<pre>
    i = 3;
    j = i++;
</pre><p>
means: leave the value of <tt>i</tt> on the stack for assignment,
then afterwards increment <tt>i</tt>. So <tt>j</tt> will get the value 3.
In the incrementation part of the <tt>for</tt> loop it does not matter
whether you use the prefix or postfix form.
<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_foreach"></a>
<h2>The <tt>foreach</tt> statement</h2><p>
<p>
The <tt>foreach</tt> loop is a convenient way to loop over the elements
of an array or matrix, without the need to `count' the number of elements:

<xmp>
    #include <oxstd.oxh>
    main()
    {
        decl as = {"AA", "BB"};

        foreach (decl s in as)
        {
            print(" ", s);
        }
    }
</xmp>

which prints <tt>AA BB</tt>. Similarly, <tt>foreach (xi in mx)</tt> loops over each
element in <tt>mx</tt>. The element variable (<tt>xi</tt> here), must be a local variable,
while the collection (<tt>mx</tt>) can be any pre-existing variable:

<xmp>
    #include <oxstd.oxh>
    main()
    {
        decl xi, mx = <1,2,3;4,5,6;7,8,9>;

        foreach (xi in mx)
        {
            print(xi);
        }
    }
</xmp>

The elements are accessed element-by-element, ordered by row, so this prints: <tt>123456789</tt>.
Sometimes it is useful to access the matrix by entire rows or columns.
Or to have access to the iterator. Both are possible:

<xmp>
    #include <oxstd.oxh>
    main()
    {
        decl xi, mx = <1,2;3,4>, i, j, vx = vec(mx);

        foreach (xi in mx[i][j])
        {
            println("element ", i, ",", j, ": ", xi);
        }
        foreach (xi in mx[i][])
        {
            println("row ", i, ": ", xi);
        }
        foreach (xi in mx[][j])
        {
            println("column ", j, ": ", xi);
        }
        foreach (xi in vx[i])
        {
            println("vector element ", i, ": ", xi);
        }
    }
</xmp>

This prints:

<xmp>
    element 0,0: 1
    element 0,1: 2
    element 1,0: 3
    element 1,1: 4
    row 0:
           1.0000       2.0000
    row 1:
           3.0000       4.0000
    column 0:
           1.0000
           3.0000
    column 1:
           2.0000
           4.0000
    vector element 0: 1
    vector element 1: 3
    vector element 2: 2
    vector element 3: 4
</xmp>

Note that changing the element does not change the matrix, and that the dimension
of the matrix os not allowed to change during the loop.

<h2>The <tt>if</tt> statement</h2><p>
<p>
The <tt>if</tt> statement allows for conditional program flow.
In the following example we draw a uniform random number.
Such a random number is always between zero and one. The <tt>ranu</tt>
returns a matrix, unless we ask it to generate just one number.
Then it returns a double, as is the case here.
<p>
<pre>
    decl d = ranu(1,1);
    if (d &lt; 0.5)
        println(&quot;less than 0.5&quot;);
    else if (d &lt; 0.75)
        println(&quot;less than 0.75&quot;);
    else
        println(&quot;greater than 0.75&quot;);
</pre><p>
Again, braces are used to group multiple statements together.
They should also be used when nesting <tt>if</tt> statements,
to avoid confusion about which <tt>else</tt> belongs to which
<tt>if</tt>.
<p>
<pre>
    decl d1 = ranu(1,1), d2 = ranu(1,1);
    if (d1 &lt; 0.5)
    {   println(&quot;d1 is less than 0.5&quot;);
    }
    else
    {   if (d2 &lt; 0.75)
            println(&quot;d1 &gt;= 0.5 and d2 &lt; 0.75&quot;);
        else
            println(&quot;d1 &gt;= 0.5 and d2 &lt;= 0.75&quot;);
    }
</pre><p>
The <tt>if</tt> part is executed if the expression evaluates to
a non-zero value (<em>true</em>). The <tt>else</tt> part otherwise, i.e. when
the expression evaluates to zero (<em>false</em>: either an integer 0, or
a double 0.0).
Some care is required when using matrices in <tt>if</tt> statements.
A matrix expression is a true statement if all elements are true
(non-zero). Even if only one element is zero, the matrix expression
is false, so
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        if (ones(2,2))  print(&quot;yes&quot;);
        else            print(&quot;no&quot;);
        if (unit(2))    print(&quot;yes&quot;);
        else            print(&quot;no&quot;);
        if (zeros(2,2)) print(&quot;yes&quot;);
        else            print(&quot;no&quot;);
    }
</pre><p>
prints: <tt>yesnono</tt>.
<p>
There are two forms of relational operators.
There is
<tt>&lt;</tt>  <tt>&lt;=</tt>  <tt>&gt;</tt>  <tt>&gt;=</tt>  <tt>==</tt>  <tt>!=</tt>
meaning `less', `less than or equal', `greater',
`greater than or equal', `is equal' and `is not equal'. These always produce
the integer value 1 (true) or 0 (false). If any of the arguments is a matrix,
the result is only true if it is true for each element:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        if (ones(2,2) == 1)  print(&quot;yes&quot;);   // true for each
        else                 print(&quot;no&quot;);          // element
        if (unit(2) == 1)    print(&quot;yes&quot;);//not true for each
        else                 print(&quot;no&quot;);          // element
        if (zeros(2,2) == 1) print(&quot;yes&quot;);//not true for each
        else                 print(&quot;no&quot;);          // element
    }
</pre><p>
prints: <tt>yesnono</tt>.
<p>
The second form are the dot-relational operators
<tt>.&lt;</tt>  <tt>.&lt;=</tt>  <tt>.&gt;</tt>  <tt>.&gt;=</tt>  <tt>.==</tt>  <tt>.!=</tt>
meaning `dot less', `dot less than or equal',
`dot greater',
`dot greater than or equal', `is dot equal' and `is not dot equal'.
If any of the arguments is a matrix,
the result is a matrix of zeros and ones, with each element indicating
the relevant result.
<p>
The <tt>any</tt> library function returns <tt>1</tt> (true) if
<em>any</em> element of the matrix is non-zero, so that
<tt>yesyesno</tt> will be printed by:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    main()
    {
        if (any(ones(2,2)))  print(&quot;yes&quot;);
        else                 print(&quot;no&quot;);
        if (any(unit(2)))    print(&quot;yes&quot;);
        else                 print(&quot;no&quot;);
        if (any(zeros(2,2))) print(&quot;yes&quot;);
        else                 print(&quot;no&quot;);
    }
</pre><p>
To conclude: you can test whether all elements
of a matrix <tt>m</tt> are equal to one (say) by
writing: <tt>if (m == 1)</tt>. To test whether any element
is equal to one: <tt>if (any(m .== 1))</tt>. The expression
<tt>if (m != 1)</tt>, on the other hand, is only true if none
of the elements is equal to one. So, use <tt>if (!(m == 1))</tt>
to test whether it is true that not all elements are equal to one.
<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_op"></a>
<h2>Operations and matrix programming</h2><p>
<p>
To a large extent, the same operators are available in Ox
as in C or C++. Some of the additional operators are
power (<tt>^</tt>), horizontal concatenation (<tt>~</tt>), vertical
concatenation (<tt>|</tt>) and the Kronecker product (<tt>**</tt>).
One important distinction is that the operators are also available
for matrices, so that, for example, two matrices can
be added up directly. For some operators, such as multiplication,
there is a distinction between the dot operators (e.g. <tt>.*</tt> is
element by element multiplication and <tt>*</tt> is matrix multiplication
if both arguments are matrices). Not available in Ox are the bitwise
operators, instead you need to use the library functions
<tt>binand</tt> and <tt>binor</tt>.
<p>
Because Ox is implicitly typed, the resulting type of the
expression will depend on the types of the variables
in the expression. When a mixture of types is involved, the result
is promoted upwards in the order integer, double, matrix.
So in an expression consisting if an integer and a double, the integer
will be promoted to a double. An expression of only integers yields
an integer. However, there are two important exceptions
to this rule:
<p>
<ol>
<li>integer division is done in floating point and yields a double.
<em>This is an important difference with C, where integer division
is truncated to an integer.</em>
<li>power expressions involving integers which yield a result too
large to be expressed as an integer give a double result.
</ol><p>
<p>
To illustrate, we write the Fahrenheit to Celsius example of <a href="#Kern88">Kernighan and Ritchie (1988)</a>
in Ox:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    const decl LOWER = 0;
    const decl UPPER = 100;
    const decl STEP  = 20;
    main()
    {
        decl fahr;
        for (fahr = LOWER; fahr &lt;= UPPER; fahr += STEP)
            print(&quot;%3d&quot;, fahr, &quot; &quot;,
                  &quot;%6.1f&quot;, (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32), &quot;\n&quot;);
    }
</pre><p>
which prints:
<p>
<pre>
      0  -17.8
     20   -6.7
     40    4.4
     60   15.6
     80   26.7
    100   37.8
</pre><p>
In C we have to write <tt>5.0/9.0</tt>, because <tt>5/9</tt>
evaluates to zero. In Ox both expressions are evaluated
in floating point arithmetic.
<p>
In general we get more more efficient code
by vectorizing each program as much as possible:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    const decl LOWER = 0;
    const decl UPPER = 100;
    const decl STEP  = 20;
    main()
    {
        decl fahr = range(LOWER, UPPER, STEP)';
        print(&quot;%6.1f&quot;,  fahr ~ (5.0/9.0) * (fahr-32) );
    }
</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>As in the first version of the program, we declare three constants
which define the Fahrenheit part of the table.
<p>
<li>The <tt>range()</tt> function creates a 1&times;n matrix
with the values <tt>LOWER</tt>, <tt>LOWER</tt>+<tt>STEP</tt>,
<tt>LOWER</tt> + 2<tt>STEP</tt>, ..., <tt>UPPER</tt>.
<p>
<li>The transpose operator <tt>'</tt> changes this into an n&times;1
matrix.
<p>
<li>The conversion to Celsius in the print statement works on the
matrix as a whole: multiplication of a matrix by a scalar is equivalent
to multiplication by the scalar of each element of the matrix.
<p>
<li>The <tt>~</tt> operator concatenates the two column vectors into
an n &times;2 matrix.
<p>
<li>Finally, the <tt>print</tt> function is different from the
<tt>printf</tt> in C. In Ox each variable to print is simply specified
sequentially. It is possible, as done here with <tt>&quot;%6.1f&quot;</tt>, to
insert formatting strings for the next variable.
</ul><p>
<p>
The program prints a table similar to the earlier output:
<p>
<pre>
      0.0  -17.8
     20.0   -6.7
     40.0    4.4
     60.0   15.6
     80.0   26.7
    100.0   37.8
</pre><p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_array"></a>
<h2>Arrays</h2><p>
<p>
The Ox syntax allows for arrays, so you may use, for
example, an array of strings (often useful),
an array of matrices, or even an array of an array of matrices
(etc.). The following program gives an example.
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    const decl MX_R = 2;
    const decl MX_C = 2;
    main()
    {
        decl i, asc, asr, m;
        asr = new array[MX_R];
        asc = new array[MX_C];
        for (i = 0; i &lt; MX_R; ++i)
            asr[i] = sprint(&quot;row &quot;, i);
        for (i = 0; i &lt; MX_C; ++i)
            asc[i] = sprint(&quot;col &quot;, i);
        m = ranu(MX_R, MX_C);
        print(&quot;%r&quot;, asr, &quot;%c&quot;, asc, m);
    }
</pre><p>
which prints
<p>
<pre>
                         col 0        col 1
    row 0             0.020192      0.68617
    row 1              0.15174      0.74598
</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>new</tt> operator declares a new object. That could be
a class object, as discussed in the next chapter, a matrix, a string,
or, as used here, an array. The argument in square brackets is the size
of the array. (When creating a matrix in this way, note that a matrix is
always two-dimensional, and needs two arguments,
as in: <tt>m = new matrix[2][2]</tt>.)
<p>
<li>The <tt>sprint</tt> functions return a string, which is stored in the
arrays.
<p>
<li>In <tt>print()</tt>, we use <tt>&quot;%r&quot;</tt> followed by an array of strings
to specify row labels for the subsequent matrix. Column labels
use <tt>&quot;%c&quot;</tt>.
</ul><p>
<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_link"></a>
<h2>Multiple files: using <tt>#include</tt> and <tt>#import</tt></h2><p>
<p>
The source code of larger projects will often be spread over several
source files. Usually the <tt>.ox</tt> file containing the <tt>main</tt> function
is only a few tens of lines. We have already seen that information
about other source files is passed on through included header files.
However, to run the entire program, the code
of those files needs to be linked
together as well. Ox offers various ways of doing this.
As an example, consider a mini-project consisting
of two files: a source code file and a header file. The third file
will contain the <tt>main</tt> function.
<p>
Mini project
[samples/myfunc.ox]
<pre>
#include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
static decl s_iCalls = 0;  // counter, initialize to 0
MyFunction(const ma)
{
    ++s_iCalls;             // increment calls counter
    println(&quot;MyFunction has been called &quot;, s_iCalls,
          &quot; times and prints:&quot;, ma);
}
</pre><p>
<p>
[samples/myfunc.h]
<pre>
    MyFunction(const ma);
</pre><p>
<p>
The header file <tt>myfunc.h</tt> <em>declares</em> the <tt>MyFunction</tt> function,
so that it can be used in other Ox files.
Note that the declaration ends in a semicolon.
The source code file contains the <em>definition</em> of the function,
which is the actual code of the function. The header of the definition
does not end in a semicolon, but is followed by
the opening brace of the body
of the function. The <tt>s_iCalls</tt> variable is declared outside
any function, making it an <em>external</em> variable. Here we
also use the <tt>static</tt> <em>type specifier</em>, which restricts
the scope of the variable to the <tt>myfunc.ox</tt> file: <tt>s_iCalls</tt>
is invisible anywhere else (and other files may contain their
own <tt>s_iCalls</tt> variable).
Variables declared inside a block of curly braces have a more limited
lifetime. Their life starts when they are declared,
and finishes at the closing brace (matching the brace level of declaration).
<p>
It is also possible to share variables between various
source files, although there can be only one declaration
(physical allocation) of the
shared variable. The following modifications would do that for
the <tt>myfunc.ox</tt> program: <br>
(1) delete the <tt>static</tt> keyword from the declaration,<br>
(2) add to <tt>myfunc.h</tt> the line
(renaming <tt>s_iCalls</tt> to <tt>g_iCalls</tt>):
<p>
<pre>
    extern decl g_iCalls;
</pre><p>
<p>
Any code which includes <tt>myfunc.h</tt> can now reference or change
the <tt>g_iCalls</tt> variable.
<p>
<a name="1.8.1"></a>
<h3>Including the code into the main file</h3><p>
<p>
The first way of combining the mini project with the <tt>main</tt>
function is to <tt>#include</tt> the actual code. In that case
the <tt>myfunc.h</tt> header file is not needed:
<p>
[samples/mymaina.ox]
<pre>
#include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
#include &quot;myfunc.ox&quot;
main()
{
    MyFunction(&quot;one&quot;);
}
</pre><p>
<p>
The result will be just one code file, and <tt>mymaina.ox</tt> can be run
as <tt>oxl mymaina</tt>.
<p>
<a name="1.8.2"></a>
<h3>Importing the code into the main file</h3><p>
<p>
The drawback of the previous method of including source code
using <tt>#include</tt>, is that it can only be done once.
That is not a problem in this short program, but is difficult
to ensure if a library is used at many points in a large project.
The <tt>#import</tt> command solves this problem.
<p>
[samples/mymainc.ox]
<pre>
#include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
#import &quot;myfunc&quot;
main()
{
    MyFunction(&quot;one&quot;);
}
</pre><p>
<p>
Again, <tt>mymainc.ox</tt> can be run as <tt>oxl mymainc</tt>.

There is no extension in the argument to <tt>#import</tt>.
The effect is as an <tt>#include "myfunc.h"</tt> statement
followed by marking <tt>myfunc.ox</tt> for linking.<br>
[<small>
<tt>#import</tt> will actually try to find the <tt>.oxo</tt> file
first. If that is not found, it will search for the <tt>.ox</tt> file.
If neither is found, the program cannot run. More detail is
in <a href="oxsyntax.html#ox_syntax_import">import of modules</a>.
</small>]<br>
The actual linking only happens when the file is run,
and the same <tt>#import</tt> statement may occur multiple times
(as well as in compiled files). So even when the same file
is imported many times, it will only be linked once.

<p>
<a name="1.8.3"></a>
<h3>Importing Ox packages</h3><p>
<p>
If <tt>myfunc.ox</tt> would require
the maximization package, it could have at the top:

<xmp>
    #include <oxstd.h>
    #import <maximize>
</xmp><p>

Partial paths can be used. Searching is relative to the
<tt>OX5PATH</tt> environment variable.
For example, if the Arfima package is in its default
location of <tt>ox/packages/arfima</tt>, we would use:

<xmp>
    #import <packages/arfima/arfima>
</xmp><p>

The distinction between angular brackets and double quotes in the
include and import statements is discussed in
<a href="oxsyntax.html#ox_syntax_include">file inclusion</a>.
Roughly, the <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> form should be used for files which are
part of the Ox system, and the double quotes for your own files,
which will not be in the Ox tree.

<p>
<a name="1.8.4"></a>
<h3>Separate compilation</h3><p>
<p>
Ox source code files can be compiled into Ox object files. These files
have the <tt>.oxo</tt> extension, and are binary. The format is identical across
operating systems, but since they are binary, transfer from one
platform to another has to be done in binary mode.
<p>
To compile <tt>myfunc.ox</tt> into an Ox object file use the <tt>-c</tt>
switch:
<p>
<pre>
    oxl -c myfunc
</pre><p>
This creates <tt>myfunc.oxo</tt> (the .oxo extension is automatically appended).
Remember that <tt>myfunc.oxo</tt> must be recreated every time
<tt>myfunc.ox</tt> changes.
<p>
Now, when rerunning <tt>mymainc.ox</tt>, it will automatically
use the <tt>.oxo</tt> instead of the <tt>.ox</tt> file.
<p>
Compiled Ox files can be useful for very large files (although
even then compilation will be very fast), or if you do not
wish to distribute the source files. They are inconvenient when
the code is still under development.

<p>
<a name="ox_tutlan_oo"></a>
<h2>Object-oriented programming</h2><p>
<p>
Object-oriented programming involves the grouping together
of functions and variables in convenient building blocks.
These blocks can then be used directly, or as starting
point for a more specialized implementation. A major
advantage of object-oriented programming is that it avoids
the use of global variables, thus making the code more re-entrant:
several instances will not conflict wiith each other.
<p>
The object-oriented features in Ox are not as sophisticated
as in some low-level languages. However, this avoids the
complexity of a language such as C++, while still providing
most of the benefits.
<p>
Ox allows you to completely ignore the object-oriented features.
However, you will then not be able to use the preprogrammed classes
for data management and simulation. It is especially in the latter
task that we found a considerable reduction in the required
programming effort after writing the base class.
<p>
The <em>class</em> is the main vehicle for object-oriented programming.
A class is nothing more than a group of variables (the data)
and functions (the actions) packaged together. This makes it a supercharged
<tt>struct</tt> (or <tt>record</tt> in Pascal terminology).
Inheritance allows for a new class
to add data and functions to the base class, or even redefine functionality
of the base class.
<p>
In Ox, the default is that all data members of the class are protected (only visible to class
members), and all function members are public. Like C++, Ox
has the <tt>virtual</tt> keyword to define functions which can be
replaced by the derived class. Classes are used by dynamically
creating objects of that class. No static objects exist in Ox.
When an object is created, the <em>constructor</em> function is called,
when the object is deleted, the <em>destructor</em> function is called.
More information on object-oriented programming is
given in the <a href="oxsyntax.html#ox_syntax_RefClasses">syntax chapter</a>.

<h2>Style and Hungarian notation</h2><p>
<p>
The readability and maintainability of a program is considerably
enhanced when using a consistent style and notation, together with
proper indentation and documentation. Style is a personal matter; this
section describes the one I have adopted.
<p>
In my code, I always indent by one tab (four spaces) at the next level
of control (i.e. after each opening brace), jumping back on the
closing brace.
<p>

I have found Hungarian notation especially
useful (see e.g. <a href="#Petz92">Petzold, 1992</a>, Ch.&nbsp;1).
Hungarian notation involves the decoration of variable names.
There are two elements to Hungarian notation: prefixing of variable
names to indicate type
(Table <a href="#TabHung1">Table 1</a>), and using case to indicate scope
(Table <a href="#TabHung2">Table 2</a>, remember
that Ox is case sensitive).
<p>
<a name="TabHung2"></a>
<center>
<h3>Table tut.1: &nbsp;Hungarian notation, case sensitivity</h3><p>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>function </td><td>all lowercase </td></tr>
<tr><td>function (exported) </td><td>first letter uppercase </td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>static</tt> external variable </td><td>type in lowercase, next letter uppercase </td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>(perhaps prefixed with <tt>s_</tt>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>exported external variable </td><td>as above, but prefixed with <tt>g_</tt></td></tr>
<tr><td>function argument </td><td>type in lowercase, next letter uppercase </td></tr>
<tr><td>local variables </td><td>all lowercase </td></tr>
<tr><td>constants </td><td>all uppercase </td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>
As an example consider:
<p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;oxstd.oxh&gt;
    const decl MX_R = 2;                      /* a constant */
    decl g_mX;                           /* exported matrix */
    static decl s_iCount;       /* static external variable */
    static func1(const pdX)/* argument is pointer to double */
    {
    }
                                       /* exported function */
    Func2(const mX, const asX, const cT, const cX)
    {
        decl i, m;
    }
</pre><p>
<p>
<tt>Func2</tt> expects a <tt>cT</tt> &times; <tt>cX</tt> matrix, and
corresponding array of <tt>cX</tt> variable names.
The <tt>c</tt> prefix is used for the number of elements in a matrix or string.
Note however, that it is not necessary in Ox to pass dimensions separately.
You can ask <tt>mX</tt> and <tt>asX</tt> what dimensions they have:
<p>
<pre>
    Func2(const mX, const asX)
    {
        decl i, m, ct, cx;
        cx = columns(mX);
        ct = rows(mX);
        if (cx != sizeof(asX))
            print(&quot;error: dimensions don't match&quot;);
    }

<details><summary><h2>Optimizing for speed</h2></summary>
<p>
Ox is very fast: current benchmarks suggest that it is faster
than most (if not all) other commonly used matrix language interpreters.
A program can never be fast enough though, and here are some
tips to achieve even higher speed:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Use matrices as much as you can, avoiding loops and
matrix indexing.
<li>Use built-in functions where possible.
<li>When optimizing a program with loops, it usually only pays
to optimize the inner most loop. One option is to move loop invariants
to a variable outside the loop.
<li>Avoid using `hat' matrices, i.e. avoid using outer products
over large dimensions when not necessary.
<li>Note that matrices are stored by row (the C and C++ default,
but transposed from the Fortran default), so it could
sometimes be faster to transpose matrices (i.e. have data variables
in rows instead of columns).
<li>If necessary, you can link in C or Fortran code.
</ul><p>

<details><summary><h2><a name="ox_tutlan_oxgauss"></a>OxGauss</h2></summary>

Ox has the capability of running a wide range of
Gauss (GAUSS is a trademark of Aptech Systems, Inc., Maple Valley, WA, USA)
programs. Gauss code can be called from Ox programs, or run on its
own. The formal syntax of OxGauss is described in
the <a href="OxDeveloper.pdf">Ox Developer's manual</a>, which also
lists some of the limitations of OxGauss, and gives a function summary.
The remainder of this chapter gives some examples on its use.
More information on OxGauss can be found:
<ul>
<li>in the <a href="OxDeveloper.pdf">Ox Developer's manual</a>,
<li>on the web: <a href="http://facweb.arch.ohio-state.edu/pviton/support/oxgauss.html"><i>Running GAUSS programs Under Ox3</i></a>
by Philip A. Viton.
</ul>


<p><h3>Running OxGauss programs from the command line</h3><p>

As an example we consider a small project, consisting of a code file
that contains a procedure and an external variable, together
with a code file that includes the former and calls the function.
We shall use the <tt>.src</tt> or <tt>.oxgauss</tt> extension for the OxGauss programs.
<p>
[samples/oxgauss/gaussfunc.src]
<xmp>
    declare matrix _g_base = 1;

    proc(0)=gaussfunc(a,b);
        "calling gaussfunc";
        retp(a+_g_base*eye(b));
    endp;
</xmp><p>

[samples/oxgauss/gausscall.src]
<xmp>
    #include gaussfunc.src;

    _g_base = 20;
    z = gaussfunc(10,2);
    "result from gaussfunc" z;
</xmp><p>

To run this program on the command line, enter
<xmp>
    oxl -g gausscall.src
</xmp><p>

Which produces the output:

<xmp>
Ox version 4.00 (Windows/U) (C) J.A. Doornik, 1994-2006
calling gaussfunc
result from gaussfunc
       30.000000        10.000000
       10.000000        30.000000
</xmp><p>

If there are problems at this stage, we suggest to start by reading the
first chapter of the <a href="OxIntro.pdf">Introduction to Ox</a>.

<p><h3>Running OxGauss programs from OxMetrics</h3><p>

Using Ox Professional, the OxGauss program can be loaded into
OxMetrics. The syntax highlighting makes understanding the program
easier.

Click on Run (the running person) to execute the program.
This runs the program using the <i>OxGauss</i> application, with the
output in a window entitled `OxGauss Session'.
OxMetrics will treat the file as an OxGauss file if it has
the <tt>.src</tt>, <tt>.g</tt> or <tt>.oxgauss</tt> extension.  If not, the
file can still be run by launching <i>OxGauss</i> from the OxMetrics
workspace window.

<p><a name="ox_tutlan_oxgimp"></a><h3>Calling OxGauss from Ox</h3><p>

The main objective of creating OxGauss was to allow Gauss code to be called
from Ox. This helps in the transition to Ox, and increases the
amount of code that is available to users of Ox.

The main point to note is that the <i>OxGauss code lives inside the</i>
<tt>gauss</tt> <i>namespace</i>. In this way, the Ox and OxGauss code
can never conflict.

Returning to the earlier example, the first requirement is to make an
Ox header file for <tt>gaussfunc.src</tt>. This must declare the
external variables and procedures explicitly in the <tt>gauss</tt> namespace:
<p>
[samples/oxgauss/gaussfunc.h]
<xmp>
	namespace gauss
	{
	    extern decl _g_base;
	    gaussfunc(const a, const b);
	}
</xmp><p>

Next, the OxGauss code must be imported into the Ox program.
The <tt>#import</tt> command has been extended to recognize OxGauss imports
by prefixing the file name with <tt>gauss::</tt>, as in the following program:
<p>
[samples/oxgauss/gausscall.ox]
<xmp>
	#include <oxstd.oxh>
	#import "gauss::gaussfunc"
	main()
	{
	    gauss::_g_base = 20;
	    decl z = gauss::gaussfunc(10,2);
	    println("result from gaussfunc", z);
	}
</xmp><p>

When the OxGauss functions or variables are accessed, they must
also be prefixed with the namespace identifier <tt>gauss::</tt>.
The output is:

<xmp>
calling gaussfunc
result from gaussfunc
       30.000       10.000
       10.000       30.000
</xmp>
