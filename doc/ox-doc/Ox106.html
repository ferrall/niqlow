<H1>Ox: Fixes and new features in version 1.06</H1>
<HR>
<H2>New features and remarks, version 1.06</H2>
<UL><LI>
<I>FastMath</I> enhancements. Several matrix operations have been
speeded up significantly. These optimizations do require
more memory though. By default <I>FastMath</I> mode is active, but if
you run out of memory, you can switch it off using the <B>-f</B>
command line switch. Affected operations are: matrix multiplication
(especially matrix cross-product), determinant, ols2c, invertsym,
correlation, variance.
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>
olsc, olsr, ols2c, ols2r functions. The first two use the QR
decomposition with pivoting. The last two use the Choleksi decomposition
of X'X, without pivoting.
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>
When printing a row vector which spans more than one line of output,
labelling of elements will only be done once at the top.
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>
Contrary to what the documentation says, eigenvalues from a general
matrix are <I>not</I> sorted. Those of a symmetric matrix are.
</LI></UL>

<H2>Fixed bugs in version 1.06</H2>
<UL><LI>
Vertical concatenation (| operator) does not work correctly when
using unequally sized matrices (the wrong parts are zeroed out).
Horizontal concatenation is fine.
</LI></UL>
<UL><LI>
Deleting something twice, or a variable which wasn't assigned to
could lead to a crash.
