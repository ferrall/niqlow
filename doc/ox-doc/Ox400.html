<hr><h2>New features and enhancements</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Added <tt>switch</tt> and <tt>switch_single</tt>
language constructs (and keywords).

<li>Direct access to data member variables of a class can
now be provided (<tt>struct</tt>, <tt>public</tt>, <tt>protected</tt>).
In a <tt>struct</tt> all members are public.
In a <tt>class</tt>, <tt>public</tt> can be used to make data public
(but <tt>protected</tt> and <tt>public</tt> do not apply to functions).

<li>New default uniform random number generator (MWC8222_52)
with period 2^8222 and using full 52-bit floating point precision.
Also new (and faster) standard normal generator based on the
ziggurat method.

Use <tt>ranseed("PM")</tt> to reset the old default for uniform and normal, in
order to replicate results from older Ox versions.

<li>New FFT function <tt>fft1d</tt>, which is faster
and works for arbitrary sample size. The original <tt>fft</tt>
now uses the faster FFT version, and still converts the sample size to a power of two.
Modified <tt>dfft</tt> to make it compatible with <tt>fft1d</tt>/<tt>fft1d</tt>.
The new FFT is based
on <a href="http://www.ffte.jp">FFTE 2.0</a> by Daisuke Takahashi.

<li><tt>dayofeaster</tt>, <tt>dayofmonth</tt>, <tt>timeofday</tt>, <tt>"%C"</tt> format.
	  
<li>W test for normality (NormTestW in lib/normtest).

<li>Added <tt>polyeval</tt>.
	  
<li><tt>MaxSQP</tt>: removed singularity message in Maratos correction
	  (now QR based), and many other improvements.

<li><tt>%t</tt> and <tt>%T</tt> <tt>sscan</tt>/<tt>fscan</tt> formats to scan a token

<li><tt>%v</tt> <tt>sscan</tt>/<tt>fscan</tt> and <tt>print</tt>/<tt>fprint</tt> formats to
read and write values a Ox constant (literals). This can be used, e.g.
to read and write the entire contants of a class object.
An example is in <tt>samples/inout/percent_v.ox</tt>.

<li>Small improvement to format handling in <tt>print</tt>/<tt>fprint</tt>
      makes it easier to print strings with % in it. For example in
	  <tt>print("%s", "%GDP")</tt> the second argument is treated as a string
	  to print, not as a format.

<li><tt>Database</tt> class uses <tt>findsample</tt> in <tt>SetSelSample</tt>; added
	  <tt>GetSelSampleMode</tt>/<tt>SetSelSampleMode</tt>; added <tt>Save</tt> and <tt>SetVar</tt>.
Added support for daily data (dated database).
Ability to read Excel files with date/time columns.

<li>Extensions to <tt>Modelbase</tt> class to support many enhancements of OxPack.

<li>Added <tt>findsample</tt>; <tt>loadmat</tt>/<tt>savemat</tt> can handle variable names

<li>Slightly more accurate tailn/probn for probablities
&gt; 1e-20 (about 14-15 significant digits correct, instead of 10-11
before).

<li>Ox can run Ox files that use non-English
characters in the filename (Windows 2000/XP).

<li>The default symbol table size is now 3000.
</ul>

<hr><h2>Fixed problems and new features in version 4.1:</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Improved PcFiml output for single equation models.

<li>
10^10 as a constant expression (i.e. outside any function)
would overflow (using integer arithmetic). Now works same as the
run-time expression.

<li><tt>Modelbase::DoOptionsDlg</tt> calls <tt>SaveOptions()</tt> when successful.

<li>The 64-bit version of Ox defines OX_64_BIT. Also, the 64-bit version will first try
<tt>xyz_64</tt> (with the appropriate .so or .dll extension) if the dynamic
link library is specified as <tt>xyz</tt> in the extern statement. So now, e.g.,
<tt>arfima.so</tt> and <tt>arfima_64.so</tt> can be installed in the arfima folder, and the
correct version will be used automatically.

<li>Fixed several problems with loading CSV files.

<li><tt>densbinomial</tt>, <tt>densgeometric</tt>, <tt>densnegbin</tt> returned .NaN
	  with p=1 or p=0.

<li>Random number generators for distributions with
      two parameters (such as <tt>rangamma</tt>) would in some circumstances
	  use the second argument as the third. This would
	  only happen if they are both matrices, conformant to the dimension
	  of the generated matrix (so not if both are scalars, the most common case). 

<li>The following code:
<xmp>
	  decl as = {"a","b"}, v = <0,1,2>;
	  println(as[v[<0:1>]]);
</xmp>
	  gave a runtime error: 'matrix[1][2]' cannot cast to int
	  while it should just work.


<li>Select Variables dialog (OP_SELECTVAR) would allow
	  database changes based on the previous incantation rather than the current.
	  The actual database change also didn't work.
	  
<li><tt>GetSampleByIndex</tt> in help: link does not work

<li><tt>countc</tt> could crash; now the second argument in <tt>countc</tt>/<tt>countr</tt>
	  can be a column as well as a row vector

<li>Fixed some corner cases of <tt>probf</tt>/<tt>tailf</tt>:	argument 0
      always returns 0 (1 for <tt>tailf</tt>), +.Inf returns 1 (0 for <tt>tailf</tt>).

<li><tt>quanbeta</tt> breaks down for large values of a and b (when
      distribution becomes quite rectangular). This was partially because of bad
	  starting values.
		
<li><tt>unvech</tt> with a scalar argument returns 0 instead of a
      1x1 matrix with the scalar.

<li>reading xls file with embedded chart data (perhaps without
	  actually holding a chart) could go wrong.

<li>Missing values for min/max in <tt>DrawAxis</tt> causes infinite loop

<li><tt>PcFiml</tt> class: Chow test didn't work in a model without regressors.

</ul>

<a name="v404"></a>
<hr><h2>Problems which have been fixed in version 4.04:</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Ox Console install in OxEdit: added <i>Ox - compile</i> command to Run menu.

<li>Changed .oxo link error to a warning if a version 3
	  compiled oxo file is used under version 4. Note that this will not help
	  with code that imports a class that has changed (Database, Modelbase e.g.).

<li><tt>countc</tt>/<tt>countr</tt> now skip over missing values.

<li><tt>savemat</tt> for .mat/.fmt file: now ignores third
	  argument if it is an array (previously generated a run-time error).

<li>Loading Excel files:<br>
	  Problem: if the first column looks like it defines a fixed frequency
	  sample and has no label, it is not loaded.
	  This has been fixed: the first column is maintained if it has a label
	  or if it has numeric data. (same as GiveWin and Ox 3,
	  Ox 4.00/4.02 would drop it).<br>
	  Enhancements:
	  <ul>
	  <li>A dot or any text starting with #N/A is treated as a missing value
	    (previously it was only #N/A exactly).
	  <li>Now dropping columns which have no entries at all (as happened in Ox 3/GiveWin)
	  <li><tt>loadmat</tt> defaults to treating strings as missing values (this is
	    as in Ox 3, but different from loading an Excel file using the
		Database class). Dates are also left untranslated by default.
		This maintains symmetry between <tt>loadmat</tt> and <tt>savemat</tt>.
	  <li>If the format argument of <tt>loadmat</tt> is set to 1 for an xls file, strings
	    and dates are read in the same way as using the Database class.
		So <tt>loadmat("x.xls")</tt> is now the same as Ox 3.x), while
		<tt>loadmat("x.xls", 1)</tt> maintains strings as numbers and translates dates).
	  </ul>
	  
<li><tt>deletec(x,&lt;&gt;)</tt> and <tt>selectc(x,&lt;&gt;)</tt> crash on empty
      second argument.

<li><tt>insertc</tt>/<tt>insertr</tt> at the position of one plus the last
      column/row crashes.

</ul>

<a name="v402"></a>
<hr><h2>Problems in version 4.00 which have been fixed in version 4.02:</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>OxPack:<br>
- main help command was not working<br>
- No <tt>OP_ESTIMATE</tt> or <tt>OP_ESTIMATE_NODB</tt>: always switch test menu entries on.


<li><tt>Modelbase::DbDrawTMatrix</tt> did not grow the database correctly
      when required.

<li><tt>eigensym</tt>: possible error in eigenvectors of blockdiagonal symmetric matrix.

<li><tt>eigensymgen</tt>: now much faster for large matrices.

<li><tt>switch</tt>/<tt>switch_single</tt> which doesn't end with <tt>default</tt> leads
      to IE Stack Error if the last case is executed and FALSE.

<tt>CTL_SAMPLEINDEX</tt> field inside <tt>OP_MATRIX_CTL</tt>: entering a
      number before the inline edit field is shown leads to crash (is fine in
	  all other control types)

<li><tt>getenv</tt> will (most likely) lead to a crash

<li>64-bit linux only: using a log file can lead to a crash
	  when printing strings with string format specifier.

<li>g2ox.ox: <tt>loaddata</tt> and <tt>savedata</tt> definition wrong

</ul>

<a name="v340"></a>
<hr><h2>Problems in version 3.40 which have been fixed in version 4.00:</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed problem with: <tt>delete x[i]</tt> where x is an array of objects.

<li>Fixed: accessing a baseclass static variable from inside a
      derived class did not work, because it behaved as if the derived
	  class had its own copy. Using the baseclass's access function
	  (if written) would work correctly though.

<li>this->undeclared[someindex] = somevalue;
	  would lead to crash in parsing after several warning messages

<li>Fixed problem with destructor within namespace

<li>trace of a scalar double is wrong (so no problem with
	  <tt>trace(&lt;1&gt;)</tt> but with <tt>trace(1.0)</tt>).
	  <tt>cdiv(&lt; .;1 &gt;,&lt; .;1 &gt;)</tt> would give divide by zero warning. Now it
	  returns <tt>&lt; .;. &gt;</tt>.

<li>The following should work but gave an error message that
      a scalar was expected:
<xmp>	  
	  decl v = <10, 20>, a = new array[ v[0] ];
</xmp>

<li><tt>countr</tt>, <tt>countc</tt>: if the intervals are not ordered,
	  the return value is filled with missing values.

<li><tt>sortcindex(&lt;&gt;)</tt> crashes.

<li>Cannot load an in7/bn7 data file which has only one observation.

<li><tt>MaxSQP</tt> could (rarely: when <tt>vc.==0</tt>) get stuck in an infinite loop in the
computation of the slope w.r.t. constraints in merit function.
Also improved <tt>MaxSQP</tt> line search.

<li><tt>SolveQP_chol</tt> could (very rarely) get stuck in an infinite loop when the
<tt>ddiag</tt> value is zero. 
</ul>

<a name="OxGauss"></a>
<h2>OxGauss</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for <tt>varput</tt>/<tt>varget</tt>.
<li>Fixed a bug has been identified in a procedure
      which (1) calls as yet undefined procedures, (2) includes two or
	  more for loops. In that case, the second (and further) loop
	  incrementation can go awry. The reason is that there is
	  insufficient space for the loop-local variables on the stack.
	  
<li>Fixed bug in y/x when it means regression
      and trap(2) is on (replacing missing values with 0).
	  ftos with character matrix didn't work:
<xmp>	  
	    let s = "test";
		print ftos( s, "%*.*s", 7, 7 );
</xmp>
</ul>
