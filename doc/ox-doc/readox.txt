Welcome to Ox, version 7.00
===========================

There are several types of installation
[A] CD-ROM installation
    - setup program for Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000 (Professional version)
    - zip file installation for all other platforms (or copy from CD)
[B] Internet installation (from www.doornik.com/download.html)
    - setup program for Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000 (Console version)
	- setup program for Linux (for Redhat package manager)
    - zip file installation for all other platforms
	  (for Windows and Linux it is recommended that you use the
	  automatic setup programs instead).


Internet installation: setup program for Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The setup program will NOT set OX7PATH and NOT update the path
statement. The former is not normally necessary because a default
is used. The latter can be done by the user if so desired.
*** If you have an old version of Ox, and install the new Ox
into another directory, you have to ensure that it is not the
old version which is run because of your PATH statement. ***
    

CD-ROM installation for Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000
------------------------------------------------
Run the install.exe program from the root directory of the CD-ROM,
and select the relevant options. Or run the oxmetrics700.exe and 
oxpro700.exe programs from the root directory of the CD-ROM.
The setup program will NOT set OX7PATH and NOT update the path
statement. The former is not normally necessary because a default
is used. The latter can be done by the user if so desired.
*** If you have an old version of Ox, and install the new Ox
into another directory, you have to ensure that it is not the
old version which is run because of your PATH statement. ***


Some important notes:
---------------------
- Ox Professional works with OxMetrics 7.
  A licensing code is required to use Ox with OxMetrics. 
- If you alread have an old Ox installed, and install the new
  version in another folder, the old path must be removed from
  the PATH statement.
- The installation program may require write access to the Windows
  system directory (InstallShield will attempt to update the uninstall
  binary if it is old). If the installation fails, you can use the
  zipfile installation instead. 


Zip file installation
---------------------
NB: for Windows and Linux it is recommended that you use
the automatic setup programs instead.

There are four setup related files:
readox.txt   -- this file
readunix.txt -- Unix related installation notes.
unzip.exe    -- Info-ZIP's unzip program
setup.bat    -- setup batch file for Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000/NT/ME/98

There are several .zip files:
oxbas700.zip  -- basic files: Ox header files, source and samples,
                 HTML documentation
                 This file is required by all zip-file installations!
oxdev700.zip  -- development kit, only required for writing DLLs to
                 extend Ox.

and for various other platforms:
oxlnx700.zip  -- Linux executables and libraries
oxosx600.zip  -- OS-X (Mac) executables and libraries
oxsun600.zip  -- Sun (Sun5) executables and libraries
oxdec310.zip  -- Dec-Unix executables and libraries
oxhp300.zip   -- HP-UX executables and libraries
oxsgi300.zip  -- SGI (Mips 2 and 4) executables and libraries
oxaix220.zip  -- IBM/AIX executables and libraries

So for Sun get at latest: oxbas500.zip and oxsun500.zip.

Ox is packaged using Info-ZIP's compression utility. The installation
uses UnZip to read the zip files.  Info-ZIP's software (Zip, UnZip and
related utilities) is free and can be obtained as source code or
executables from various bulletin board services and anonymous-ftp sites,
including CompuServe's IBMPRO forum and ftp.uu.net:/pub/archiving/zip/*.
The executable unzip files are also downloadable from my homepage.


Completing the basic installation
---------------------------------

To run Ox from other directories (assuming you installed on the C drive
in c:\ox), add:

    c:\ox\bin

to your PATH statement in the autoexec.bat file (under Windows XP/2000/NT
use the system icon in the control panel).
If this is set, you can run an Ox program called test.ox as
   oxl test
Otherwise you need to type:
   c:\ox\bin\oxl test


You do NOT need to add the line:

    set OX7PATH=c:\ox\include;c:\ox

because that is the default when the OX7PATH variable is not set.
However, if you have additional folders in which you want Ox to
search, you have to use the above statement with the additional
folders appended. 


Ox Professional
---------------
The components in the Windows version which enable using OxMetrics 7
are part of the professional release.  See Availability in the
online Ox documentation. These components are primarily OxRun.exe,
OxDebug.exe and some DLLs (to interact with GiveWin), as well as
oxli.exe (the debug/interactive version).

Registry
--------

The Console executables do not use the registry (they use
the OX7PATH environment variable).
OxRun and OxDebug automatically register themselves when run.

The entries in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT are for file types:
    .ox        (points to OxFile entry)
    OxFile     (Ox source code files)
All persistent data is stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER under
Software\OxMetrics7.
