<h2>October 2014 release:  official version 2.0 release on github </h2>
<DL>
<DT>Overall</DT>
<DD>niqlow is now on <a href="http://github.com/ferrall/niqlow">github</a></DD>
<DD>Examples documentation is now inside <code>doc/</code> and available online at <a href="http://ferrall.github.io/niqlow">github.io</a>.</DD>
<DT>DDP</DT>
<DD>Too many bug fixes and improvements to list </DD>
<DT>Five0</DT>
<DD>Very little has changed with FiveO since March 2014</DD>
<DT>CFMPI</DT>
<DD>Fixes to high level and DIY versions of the code</DD>
</DL>
<P/>
<h2>March 2014 release</h2>
<DL>
<DT>Code now requires Ox 7.</DT>
<DT>Overall</DT>
<DD>New <code>update_sharc</code> script in <code>downloads</code> which <code>wget</code>s the current snapshot version, <code>unzip</code>s it and compiles the shared object file for CFMPI.  User will have to modify the script for their local MPI and C installations.</DD>
<DT>DDP</DT>
<DT>FiveO</DT>
<DD>ParallelObjective now integrates CFMPI into optimization algorithms.</DD>
<DT>CFMPI</DT>
<DD>Now fully object-oriented and no longer uses <em>static</em> functions for MPI calls.</DD>
<DD>Header now simplified. Now just <code>include "UseMPI.ox"</code></DD>
<DT>Examples</DT>
</DL>
<P/>
<h2>Late Changes and Issues with July 2013 release</h2>
<DL>
<DT>Printing, saving tasks are now included as methods in the new <code>DPDebug</code> class</DT>
<DT>All methods that add states to the model now handle state blocks and lists of variables.  <code>AddBlock</code> methods have been removed.</DT>
<DT>Fixed and Random effects are now handled properly. Blocks of group variables, but density with RandomEffectBlocks not correct yet.</DT>
<DT>Added Discretized class to map continuous variable to discrete points. </DT>
</DL>

<DD>		Fixed solve as system
<P/>
<DT>	Solving
